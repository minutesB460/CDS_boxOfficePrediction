(a great deal of actors who were originally cast in this movie pulled out at the last minute or didn't even bother to show up) i guess that is the beauty of this movie though. nair wanted to capture the essence of the punjabi people in a true setting. she didn't want to go for the big elaborate sets where people spontaneously break out into a big song and dance number like you see in a lot of bollywood movies. nair wanted her characters to start singing because that is what they do. one of her comments compared indians to the irish as two cultures who love to use song. throughout the whole movie, you get such a feeling of reality as if you are a voyeur who is really looking into these people's lives. they are lying naked and vulnerable before us. the character of alice really stood out for me. tilotama shome's talent radiated from her and i found myself wondering what other films she had done. in nair's commentary, the answer was revealed: zero. shome was an english literature student in delhi university. the scene wear alice is pretending to be a bride (like a child playing dress up) is so simple yet so powerful and beautiful. i have a few reviews stating that tilotama was miscast as the maid. that she was to \"elegant\" and self aware to play such a character, however, that is exactly what nair wanted in the character of alice. nair wanted to make a statement about people. our beauty and presence comes from within our soul, not from our lot in life. tilotama shome can have a brilliant career ahead of her if she wants it. it is also worthwile to mention two more exceptionally powerful performances by vijay raaz (who was a struggling actor before this movie) as dubey (alice's love interest) and shefali shetty, as ria (who has a dark secret that can ruin the binds of family) these three performances were outstanding, but the entire cast was incredible. this movie is definitely worth seeing, but i really have to recommend you watch it like i did - more than once. it really is worth it.", "i was skeptical at first about seeing this movie. i'm not into bollywood movies at all. i saw this film with a high school senior class in newark, new jersey and they were captivated by the film as well as myself. mira nair is becoming one of the world's best known film directors as i write this review with namesake on it's way to release. the characters were fully fleshed out rather than just caricatures. who didn't love the wedding planner who curses like a sailor and the servant who succumbed to his charm and spell? who didn't love the actual couple based on arrangement between families? the bride has a secret that could have destroyed or stopped the marriage. my sister's friend is probably going to be married in new delhi herself. i wonder how similar and different the wedding and reception will be. from what i know about indian weddings, i can invite you which means you, your family, friends, and neighbors. they appear to have a really good time at weddings in india. there was a serious topic that could have dampened or ruined the movie but it was well-orchestrated by the director.", "this movie is full of joy. happy, cheerful, with so many characters, and most of them good, interesting ones. it is the story of a wedding in upper class delhi. a large family spread all over the world reunites for the big event and all the ties and feelings between siblings, cousins, parents, friends are shown and expressed in a light but touching way. love, friendship, envy, pain, sorrow, loneliness, passion and hope in a nearly perfect mix. this movie is full of colours and music, and it is an accurate portrait of modern india (the wealthier part of it at least). all actors are good, and some of them are gorgeous too. very refreshing as there are no super stars, no blood, no perfect special effects, no sex. mira nair you are great ! hope you'll give us many other movies this good.", "i went to to see this film almost by chance and i was rewarded by a gem. a truly sublime mix of musical, social comment and romantic movie-making at its best. unlike many others i was not familiar with mira nair's work at all, but after having seen how she delicately handles child-abuse, pre-arranged-marital-infidelity, growing old and trying to be different as an upper middle class indian boy, being a flirtatious, bored but basically settled non-resident indian housewife, or being a too well-doing for your own class \"wedding-parties producer\" desperately seeking for love - i have surrendered!this is a great film by a great director and you might not want to miss it...", "it's only march, but i already nominate \"monsoon wedding\" as one of the best movies of the year. yeah, we've seen ethnic weddings/family gatherings before (\"lovers and other strangers,\" \"wedding banquet,\" \"the godfather,\" \"avalon,\" \"what's cooking,\" \"tortilla soup,\" among others), but this is still an original.not just because it takes place in india, not just because the characters come in from the indian diaspora of it jobs in the u.s., australia, and the middle east to the old homestead, and switch between hindi and english mid-sentence, and switch comfortably between tradition and modernity. but because these are completely wholly-formed, original characters and a sophisticated story. yeah i was confused sometimes about who's related to whom, but from the rebellious teen-age boy dreaming of being a chef, to the bride with a secret lover, to the houston engineer come home for an arranged marriage, to the complicated intra-family obligations and past positive and negative interactions, to cousins, aunts and uncles who genuinely love each other -- all are fully realized and completely believable, being both very individual and very universal. only a smidgen of a coincidence in the last moments of a too neat happy ending for a very sympathetic character mars the story, but understandably the audience cheers at the end. a bonus is the wonderful use of indian music -- i have zero idea if it's folk or bollywood music they're singing but the soundtrack is exotic and exuberant as the characters use it to liberate thoughts and feelings within the structure of wedding rituals, with dancing as well. stay through the credits as the ritual continues. i'm ready to go see it again any time i'm feeling down. (originally written 3/11/2002)", "watching this movie was, for someone such as me, who had fallen in love with delhi and nsd(national school of drama, new delhi), almost simultaneously (no, i was not a student there; i just went to watch their plays) more than a decade ago, a journey down memory lane. and not just me! many of my friends, who spent a considerable time in delhi at some or other point of their life, agreed with me on this point. in the words of one of my friends,\"monsoon wedding is a documentary about delhi.\". for me, it was thrilling to view the places near jama masjid, where once i spent many afternoons at my friend's home, (and surely, nor far from where dubey's residence would be!) after so many years. but then what can i do? \"we are like that only.\"this movie has some of the best indian actors, such as naseeruddin shah, khulbhushan kharbanda and rajat kapoor in it. but the guy who beats all of them and steals the show is our dubeyji, vijay raaz. i had noticed him first in the movie \"jungle\", where his portrayal of an almost silent (had he taken omerta, by any chance?) bandit-gang member was excellent; but in monsoon wedding, his portrayal of dubeyji beat all these first-rate actors. i've been a great fan of naseeruddin shah for quarter of a century now; but in this movie, my vote goes to raaz.the most striking feature of this movie is mira nair's ultimate attention to detail. (i think this is also a major factor that adds such authenticity to the character of dubey!). from the hindu ritualistic red-thread worn by shah on his wrist (it must be put for the movie, shah being a muslim in real life, or was it that his real-life hindu wife made him wear that!), to the pair of shorts worn by raaz, nair & co. has painstakingly paid enough amount of attention to details. a dubey would surely dress, talk and carry himself the way depicted in this movie. his choice of profanities are the most authentic that one would hear on the streets of delhi. alice and ria also put very powerful performances!this movie took me back to delhi, and to the corridors of the univ. i (and nair, much before i, for that matter!) once walked on. anyone who loves, or plans to fall in love with, delhi should watch this movie, because as mauz once said, \"who would go away, mauz, leaving the labyrinths of delhi behind?\" (kaun jaye, mauz, dilli ki galiyan chhod kar?).notes: the following is in response to some of the comments by western reviewers.1) just because he addresses his nephew as \"idiot\", the bride's father is not mean and abusive; this is just a term of endearment. i guess, this is just a matter of cultural difference; things that are accepted in the orient may be completely offensive in the occident, and vice versa. this reminds me of the autobiographical note by the egyptian born nobel laureate, prof. ahmed zewail, whose (toally accepted and used in the arab world) figure of speech \"i will kill you\" terrified a classmate at caltech (or was it berkeley?).2) some people thought that the two guys sharing a bed (when the young girl offers a kind of striptease show to the australian guy) was a hint at homosexuality; it was not! i don't mean that homosexuality does not exist in india; but it's quite common in india for people to share a bed when there's a shortage of beds (especially when a number of relatives and guests come down for, say, a wedding, to stay overnight, and then mostly younger members of the family are pushed to share beds.). note: robert de niro and hervey keital slept on the same bed in \"mean streets\", but they were not gay either!3) would the maid and the wedding planner be allowed to dance with the upper-class family? my answer is: i think, yes! most of the punjabi weddings include whiskey/alcohol in the menu (at least, for the important guests), and once you have alcohol in your veins, universal brotherhood (bhai-chara in hindi) prevails. i, in spite of not being a punjabi or a native delhiite, took part in such wedding dances myself at times, and had seen with my own eyes such situations.", "here's a movie which is not made for arty cinema lovers per se. it captures the craziness surrounding a typical north indian wedding. i liked the lead characters since they were credible and interesting. they were so normal people unlike mainstream indian cinema from bollywood. it made me chuckle at times. -gg", "i really liked this film. as the movie progressed i quickly formed a bond with the characters and felt they were all my close friends and i was somehow involved in the story. i truly got caught up in the emotion and the evolution of the story and frequently laughed and cried. although the wedding was the climax of the film, it was not what the film is about. the colors were exquisite, the music and dancing delightful and the people gorgeous. the acting was superb. if there was anything negative to say, i did have some trouble understanding some of the dialogue because of the accents and fast talking. but i intend to see it several times more. thanks for a great film.", "i have to admit that i don't really know much about east indian weddings, so what i saw in \"monsoon wedding\" was totally new. focusing on the various events and revelations surrounding a wedding in india (no, this isn't a south asian version of \"my big fat greek wedding\"), the movie is really something. i will say that as for director mira nair, i liked her \"mississippi masala\" better, but this one is still interesting. we may think of indian movies as over-the-top musicals, but this shows that there are other kinds of cinema coming from the subcontinent. the only cast member whom i recognized was roshan seth (you may remember him from \"gandhi\" and \"indiana jones and the temple of doom\").all in all, a pretty neat movie.", "in delhi, the wealthy father of the bride (lalit, played by n. shah) prepares an elaborate wedding. we meet his extended family, arriving from as far as america for the wedding, beginning with a formal engagement party 4 days before. several subplots are followed: additi, the bride, has chosen an arranged marriage instead of waiting for her married lover to leave his wife. ria, her cousin, has never married and is being pestered by all concerned. we learn that ria's father, lalit's big brother, has passed away and so lalit is her father-figure as well. dubey, the wedding organizer, becomes smitten with alice, lalit's maid. as the days pass, family joys and family secrets are revealed.i cannot praise this movie enough. first of all, kudos to n. shah for a sensitive, complex portrayal that never, for a moment, feels like acting. without hand-held camera pretensions, monsoon wedding nonetheless feels more like meeting a family at a big affair than watching a movie. it is real and intimate, yet magical. all the performances are good; rajat kapoor as an uncle with a secret is particularly powerful, and bears a striking resemblance to a younger donald sutherland.we see indian society as india sees it. my coworker, sreeman, tells me that everyone attends neighborhood weddings; that an average wedding has 800900 guests, and his had 1200. traditionalism matters, but modernity matters as well. at one point, lalit and dubey argue over the wedding tent; should it be white, the modern (western) way, or should it be colorful? lalit demands color and dubey orders \"the old kind.\" the struggle between modern and traditional ways is one of the primary undercurrents of the film, embodied by additi's choice, in fact, we meet her married lover as the host of a tv talk show discussing traditional versus modern ways.another undercurrent is finding love, impediments to love, and choices about love. additi, dubey, ria, and another cousin, rahul, all have barriers to overcome before they have a chance at happiness.but the main theme is family, and this huge, chaotic family is a wonder to behold. you can't always tell who's related to whom, but you get the sense that they can't either, and coming from a large, extended family myself, i know that's how it is. family is everything to lalit, yet he communicates harshly with a son he doesn't understand, and calls nephew rahul \"idiot.\" yet his love and devotion are clear, and he is the real hero of this film, coming through for everyone and stretching himself to the limit.", "ok first id like to say im not to familiar with the customs from that region, but i saw the movie anyway and i liked it. the different story lines, the colorful characters, the music. i was really pleased with the ending.i might go so far as to i was moved, by the entire movie. i think it was done very well, enough so that id like to see more.", "i really loved this movie. it was the first dvd i bought when i got a player. the story is rich and full of meaning, the actors are wonderful and the music is awesome. as another reviewer mentioned, i am trying to pass the word about this movie to everyone i can. please just don't compare it to my big fat greek wedding! that movie was cute and maybe more people could relate to it, but that is because it lacked any real substance. i didn't hate it, but it doesn't begin to touch monsoon wedding's issues: family, trust, abuse, love, grief, joy, tradition and oh so much more. when you are done seeing this movie, you want to see it again. and my first time i did just that. i watched it one evening and got up and watched it again the next day. now, i consider this a really substantial movie, but i have to be petty for just one moment and say... hot indian guys! i mean hot! all right,i digress. this is the best movie i have seen in a long time.", "if you're expecting an \"exotic india\" kind of movie, you'd be better off not seeing it. this is a contemporary film, and it's made with love. acting is terrific, and it becomes obvious that actors had so much synergy while working on the movie. only a very cynical person wouldn't be emotionally touched by the story and the characters. a great film to see with your significant other on a weekend. warm fuzzy feelings all the way!", "this is a truly beautiful, thoughtful, humorous and wonderful film about the human spirit, the importance of family and the healing power of unconditonal love. the acting was strong, the script was great, and the men were foyne! i loved especially parvin dabas who played hemit (the romantic interest/fiancee of aditi). this is mira nair's strongest work to date. i am glad to see other people enjoyed it, too.", "i first saw this film in mumbai, where though i missed the sub-titles that made my appreciation of its humour clearer, i was surrounded by the atmosphere of a large indian crowd, the plaintive cinema advertising (please do not spit or urinate in the street!)and the positive expectation created by friends who had already seen it back home and enjoyed it.the characters are wonderful and the film is well scripted to make maximum money by appealing to an international audience, making it easy for americans, australians, dubai residents and more to identify with people in the movie.the focus is on the family coping with each other and each member of the family facing him/herself as the wedding draws near. though they are well off superficially, they are feeling the pressure of impending change. there is a great deal of interest in each person's circumstances. the film-maker withholds moral judgment of the main characters, but occasionally puts their \"problems\" into proportion by incorporating powerfully atmospheric street scenes where the masses of the city population, handkerchiefs over mouths as an optimistic prophylactic as fight for survival in the city of 20 million.the wedding broker's sub-plot is both comic and touching. what he achieves on a personal level gives us more satisfaction that the outcome of the real couple.i disagree with another reviewer who describes this film as cheerful throughout. i have already indicated two aspects which make viewers less than comfortable (the predicament of the general population, the pathos of the parallel story); there is also the sinister amorality of two of the main characters which are dark elements until they are exposed and partially resolved as the film proceeds.in an understated manner, the film depicts the traditions of the various hindu marriage ceremonies. there are some beautifully detailed touches (eg the elaborate rangoli of orange and maroon marigolds down each side of the main drive of the family home). other tiny decisions would touch at the heart of an indian away from home or caught between two cultures (eg a volume of rabindranath tagore poetry contrasting as bedtime reading for one of the girls compared with cleo for the other).the music and dance make for a great souvenir cd if you can get hold of it. though they are woven into the story-telling instead of being patched-in as you might expect of a bollywood production, there is still a loving nod to the indian seductive movements of body and melody. that funny little nod of the head we associate with india is there too.not a lot has been missed to take us to the wedding in our imaginations. we are passive observers, as the characters on screen deal with what life throws them. but as we leave the theatre, we find ourselves thinking about our own challenges, flirtations, foolishness.see the film. see if you agree with me there's much more than cheerfulness in it.", "it's surprising how often the ratings belie the movie or vice versa. this movie is an entertaining collection of love stories which deftly cuts across so many barriers,whether they be cultural, social, class or religion. it is funny in a very real and potent way and the character development has been executed to great details in an effortless fashion. that probably is one of the hallmarks of a really gifted director.the story revolves around the preparations of an indian arranged marriage. the main characters are the bride,her father and a marriage arrangement contractor. all dealing with their own constraints and still trying to give their hopes wings. what is remarkable is that this movie has characters who show courage when they have a lot to lose and win higher rewards like love,trust and self-respect in the process. kudos to the monsoon wedding team!", "very well made film from india gives us a contemporary look at a culture that isn't seen very often. the wardrobe is very detailed and interesting as we see how they dress in todays world. some wear the old style sari's while others have on modern suits and other clothing. lots of different story angles going on all at the same time and the one i enjoyed most is the wedding planner pk who finds a girl while on the job. some of the stories are very serious while others are a little humorous and some work better than others but by the time the film ends i had a little smile on my face. just to remind myself that i did enjoy this film.", "mira nair has outdone herself in this film by giving us such a glorious look at india's upper classes during a pre-arranged wedding. she has such a sense of color and spectacle, yet she doesn't beat around the bush in presenting us the reality of the situation and treating it with dignity and realism.the hypocrisy of bollywood is legendary by not attacking issues in their films, yet they are real and need to be addressed. the mere fact that this bride is not what she's supposed to be on the surface, is an eye-opener. then there's a relative who is a pedophile and who has hidden behind a benevolent facade only to pry on the little ones of his own people. this is the first time i have seen such frank treatment of a troubled family, who is very happy, on the surface.the acting is first rate with outstanding performances by mr. shah, as the father of the bride and his daughter, ms. das. not only that, but ms. das has one of the most beautiful faces in the indian cinema and certainly deserves to be seen anywhere with those gorgeous eyes of hers.the weakest part, i thought, was that of the romance of the party planner and the maid. i mean, hello, ms. nair, do you think for one nanosecond this uppity family would have allowed the maid and her newly found love participate in the wedding party? i don't think so!the color of delhi's streets, the magnificent wedding costumes and the glorious background music are used with knowledge and a sure hand by ms. nair. having seen all her films, we await eagerly for more of her view of her home land. we can even go singing in the rain after seeing the film!", "'monsoon wedding' directed by mira nair, is the story of aditi, a young woman who is in love with a married man, yet has acquiesced to an arranged marriage in india. her husband-to-be is fairly americanized, having studied abroad, and is planning on taking his new bride to america after they marry.the story takes place during the important four days before the wedding, featuring the various parties and engagement ceremony until the eventual wedding itself. during this time, there are several subplots revealed, involving fledgling love, the institution of family in india, and buried family scandal.nair provides a very beautiful setting for the film, the most prominent feature within this setting being the incredible bright colors of the wedding decorations and wardrobe. using what are presumably true aspects of indian tradition, she presents us with gorgeous ceremonies and a fantastic soundtrack. 'monsoon wedding' isn't merely eye candy however; there is a rich story and good performances to back up the presentation. characters who, on the onset seem to be shallow or even repugnant in the early portion of the film develop into full and likable characters. there are several primary roles in the film, so no one actor has a breakout role, though p.k (vijay raaz), the wedding planner and ria (shefali shetty), a cousin of the bride to be are both especially engaging.'monsoon wedding' is an enjoyable film that wasn't particularly fantastic, but it did have some beautiful aspects to it, and the story was very well told, something that isn't always a given when most obvious attention has been given to the aesthetic of the film. 6/10.--shelly", "*this may contain spoilers*for me it was more like watching a home video than a movie. indian punjabi weddings are like that, loud and colorful, people coming in from practically everywhere, weird uncles and aunties who just don't know how to mind their own business, cousins coming in from abroad who have no clue whatsoever, iitian settled abroad. this movie never fails to entertain me, i must have seen it 20 times but every time i find something new in it. the most disturbing part was the issue of incest brought up. a lot of people feel it's uncommon in india but the sad reality is, it's not. it's very common, the thing is people hardly come out, it's under the covers and we have to accept this reality. the wonderful part was, a lot of people got to know about the issue and took notice. my father cries every time he watches the movie, esp. the scenes related to shefali. i loved naseer's character, he was like just another father cribbing over money spent on he marriage at the same time, being the happiest man on earth and going to every extent to ensure a great wedding. every character in the movie was well sketched in terms of having their own unique characters, dubeyji being this harassed wedding planner in love with the house maid, that aunty from australia who has her own story to tell, the brother being a little anti social and a bit feminine according to the father (which was really cute, the relationship), the mother who smokes in the loo, the young cousin trying to impress the boy, loud uncle. shefali's character was beautiful, her past and her present just gets twisted when the uncle enters the household and how she tries to protect her cousin. i have always liked movies which show strong human tendencies & human relationships and this was one of them. this movie was a huge hit abroad as well just because, people could relate to the movie. it is everyone's story, me, ur's, anyone's !", "i really wanted to like this film since so many other serious filmgoers were raving about the quality of the film. i found the story to be lacking. there are far too many characters in this film and little depth dedicated to the development of each individual. there is an element of insincerity in the film. is this an exploration of modern day india, colliding with modern day manners? or is this just a happy confection dedicated to the idea that all's well that ends well as long as we can celebrate with a party?the bride to be is in love with a married television producer who will never leave his wife. when she breaks up with him, she decides that she needs to come clean with her husband to be before they can honestly begin their life together. how many men would go for this? she was obviously emotionally entangled with this other man yet will go ahead with this new marriage because it will take her away from india and give her a fresh start.i was looking for a film that spoke authentically about emotions and love. this wasn't the one.the search continues.", "a good recipe of indian food is neither bland nor too spicy, like mulangtany soup, a perfect blend. if any indian film maker (more like non resident indian film maker) who can make best of the masala, that would be mira nair. the story is superbly woven, with characters that are indelible. the cell phone wielding dube, played by vijay raaz (a new find from nair) and his love interest, stand out and shine. with all the melodies and enchanting choreography in the hindi films, her choice of a mediocre \"chuiniri-chuniri\" number is not only sad, but shows immaturity in her knowledge of hindi films. this is a movie that shows the vibrant colors, the intricacy of the intimate relations with gay abandon. it is not surprising that this is the only indian movie that has been seen by more people outside india, than in india-to the tune of thirty million-that is testament to the talent of film maker, in the caliber of mira nair.", "monsoon wedding is one of the very very few indian films for the educated global audience. i had been keeping myself away from watching this film for more than a decade. thanks to the regular diabetically sweet and intellectually starved bollywood films. nevertheless, i am more than glad i finally watched this one.mira nair's film presents a voyeuristic view of an ordinary next door type north indian wedding. the story revolves around not one but many well developed characters brought in together for a wedding on a rainy day invigorating hues of different emotions in the viewer.the film honestly tries to bring out the true dimensions of human relationships in a society where the imperfect things in life are swept under the carpet as if they cease to exist. along with joy, fun and frolic of a colourful nuptial, the film offers glimpses of issues such as child sexual abuse, homosexuality,incest and infidelity with plausible sensitivity and intelligence.probably, that is what sets this film apart from any other indian film. although india is a minefield of sub-cultures,customs and traditions, i recommend this film to anyone who would really like to have a much fairer comprehension of india and its people.", "this film was screened at the venice film festival and i saw it there. when i came out of the theater i was happy, this film filled me with music, colors, a positive attitude towards life. it shows that it is possible to make a good film without special effects or sex scenes or blood dripping everywhere. if you have a story to tell, then you may have a good film, and mira nair has made it. the film is crowded with characters, the members of a family gathering together for the marriage of a young woman in new delhi: we trace their stories, retrieve facts and feelings about their lives, get to know them, even when drama is behind the corner and the past seems to mix with the present. the family is not without flaws, yet the marriage is eventually celebrated as monsoon rain pours down to wash away their faults. wet bride lucky bride, we say in italy.", "for all its hype, it was disappointing. frequently, it seems that the camera is following a real wedding. it may sound like a good approach theoretically, but practically while watching the movie, it is difficult to follow the dialogue when there are multiple people speaking at the same time.all the romantic subplots were quite predictable, the subplot with the event planner's romance was actually more interesting than the main plot.the director puts in a few scenes of delhi intermittently which serves no purpose. it is not \"salaam delhi\".there were way too many characters for you to get to know anyone. only naseer's character is central and even his role will be nowhere close to his superior performances in movies like \"masoom\" and \"izaazat\".", "i had watched this movie back when it came out. i am usually very afraid to watch again movies that i liked very much many years before, because time does leave its marks on many great movies. this was a shocker: not only i still remembered the story lines after all this time, but it's still that great, yes it is: we empathize with many characters, the acting itself is absolutely top notch, the explosion of colors on the screen is not empty forms: the contents are just as beautiful. i think one of the threads of the movie is how the different characters feel and express love along with the drama that comes with this soaring feeling that's love. i am only a small amateur, but i witness the use of the camera is absolutely timeless: the camera is held in such a manner that makes the events come out on your screen in a more realistic way. this style of using the camera mimicking an amateur taking the shooting is still used today, 17 years after the movie was made! i want to tell people who liked this years ago, fear not and watch it again, tears will come out freshly!", "really touches on subjects that a lot of indian communities don't discuss, the ins and outs of family ties. it's very eye opening and forward thinking this film a lot of issues we should openly discuss! great film!!", "monsoon wedding is an ode to family, to fun, to the joy of celebrations.. made on a meager budget of 1 million dollars and shot in thirty days, the film gives us an inside look into a punjabi family. lalit verma (naseeruddin shah) and his wife pimmi (lillette dubey) are in the throes of preparations for the wedding of their daughter aditi (vasundhara das) with hemant (parvin dabas). there is a foul mouthed wedding planner p. k. dubey (vijay raaz), a demure maid alice (tilotama shome), a cousin ria (shefali shetty) with many secretes in her eyes, countless other cousins, aunts and uncles. all gathered in the house. aditi thinks she is in love with her married boss but eventually realizes he is just stringing her along. the wedding plans go on apace, with an engagement, a ladies sangeet and finally the big day itself. but the oppressive heat prior to the monsoon also brings many troubles and past traumas out to the fore. lalit has to make difficult choices but in the end like a cleansing monsoon down pour his decisions heal past hurts and make the wedding celebration in the rain more joyous.the movie is anchored by exceptionally strong performances from naseer shah, lillette dubey, vijay raaz, tilotama and shefali shetty. other more minor players also do a very good job. the movie is full of moments that one can identify with, laugh at, weep at and generally get maudlin over. my favorite scenes are naseer constantly calling the aussie cousin idiot, the dance number at the post engagement party when the whole crowd joins in (i wanted to dance in the aisles too), the dynamics between mr. dubey and alice, the song aaaja saanwariya tohe garwa laga loon as mr. dubey goes to his old delhi home...this is a fine film that celebrates family and is a great one for repeat watching. mira's directing is deft and the movie is extremely accessible to audiences the world over.", "this movie is about an indian wedding, involving many generation of people from different background, all tossed together.it starts off by trying to create the feverish atmosphere of a upcoming wedding, with display of different characters doing different things, relatives coming over from left and right, different events going on relating to the planning of the wedding. in the midst of the whole thing, a mass of confusion is created, with neither the characters nor plot properly introduced. this left subsequent scenes in which those characters had important roles confusing.many of the more controversial topics were glossed over, or just made to work out, especially about arranged marriage, woman's passive role or their independence are treated in society. this being a movie that takes place in india, some of them would be taken for granted, but it is still, after all, a story of modern day india with a modern woman at the center. the molestation subplot seemed to be the only issue that had any seriousness in the film. everything else seems to be happy and giddy.the music and score were done very well, with the introduction of dancing not in the usually spontaneity that usually occur in bollywood movies. at the same time, adding to the feel of the movie.all in all, it was still a fun movie to watch.", "bar none. this one is a reaffirmation of life and love and thecommitments that bind the two forever. forget that you don't reallyknow anything about indian culture or language. it speaks thelanguage of the human heart -- and that is always universal. i can'twait to watch this one again, and strongly encourage everyone tosee it.", "the way i see it; this is a pretty good, fun and charming movie to pass some time with but it definitely isn't something too impressive or brilliant.the good news is that this movie is very watchable for just about everybody. you don't have to be into bollywood movies to like or appreciate this movie. yes, the movie is very indian but yet not really typical bollywood like.it basically is a very simple movie, with its setup. it's set during and around an arranged wedding and the movie follows multiple different members of the family and others involved. but it does in in such a way that the movie still feels focused enough and keeps a pleasant flow to its storytelling.but what the movie is lacking with its storytelling is some edge. i feel that the movie too often decides to play things on the safe side and it doesn't goes quite far enough with some of its themes and story lines. it makes the movie quite tame but at the same time of course also more enjoyable to watch, so it's not like it ruins the movie or makes it a completely unwatchable one.the characters all have something going for them and most are likable ones, which make them and this movie pleasant to follow. there are definitely a bunch of different characters in this movie but the movie does a good job balancing things out between each and everyone of them. it never looses its focus, though it so easily could had done that, at certain points.the movie is also a colorful one, which of course adds to its overall atmosphere and enjoyment level, though the movie still definitely is being a serious drama as well. but luckily it's no melodrama and actually picks some realistic themes and has all of its characters responding and coping with it in a very realistic manner.a good movie to watch, that you might even end up loving. after all, it's a quite popular movie!7/10", "although entertaining in some sense; wedding offers nothing new and confirms that ms. nair still lacks in her films the following: narrative flow, subtlety and basic crafts of filmmaking which differentiates a good movie from an average or a bad one. walking out of the theater one feels good about the vibrant colors of india, it's free spirit that is omnipresent, the music (albeit not original) but cannot deny the fact that a lot of people with a handheld camera, lacking illusions about cinema verite and a sudden urge to make a film in 30 days or less can churn out better stuff than monsoon wedding. this fails to represent the subject matter helped by the absence of a plot (albeit good potential narrative) and presence of too many sub-plots and at the end of it all we have a cinematic mess in our hands wondering what was ms nair thinking? may be the sad truth is filmmaking in a lot of people's mind does not equate to good storytelling and a thoughtful representation of the subject matter in hand.did the jurors at venice film festival actually see the movie or they were happy to note that wedding is not your everyday bollywood production? sadly, it is not too far from it either", "i had no difficulty with the language and the subtitles. after all, this is how i speak ;-).as a non-resident indian living in the us for three decades, the film reflects the reactions of my family and friends back in india every time i return for a visit.the story revolves authentically around the way rich, cosmopolitan indians live. (i was not one of them, but i have been to the houses of richer classmates during my college days.)mira nair has shown how to have the cake and eat it too. the movie has many elements of \"typical\" hindi movies (music, dance, and convolutions)without the inanities.as a traier, i had a group of participants in a cultural diversity workshop watch the movie. we then debriefed the audience to locate universal cross-cultural simiarlities.", "this is one foreign film i can recommend to all movie fans. although i was not familiar with any of the cast they did an outstanding job. the only difficulty i has was the switching between titles and english speaking parts. it was an unusual story and very enjoyable. i would recommend this to all audiences, as it is in limited release and may not make it to your local movie house. but don't let this one get away!", "this movie caught my attention accidentally this afternoon on tv and it held me till the end.i've always appreciated highly the rarity of unexpected film pleasure.this kind of surprise is surely unique.i've read about this movie before so it didn't take long (actually 20 minutes) to find out what i was watching!anyway , it's a really delightful film. colourful both in image and emotions.modern in its own strange way.by all means worth seeing.i'd say it's a great hollywood(40%)-bollywood(60%) mix.the one with exceptional direction , cinematography and on screen performances.this first impression compels me to award it with a rating as high as 8,5 out of 10.", "it was a blast watching this movie. very entertaining. too bad this was not shown at a better equipped theatre here in toronto. however, the audience was great, and some people were tapping along with the music, including myself and my boyfriend! we watched it right after having dinner at a fabulous indian restaurant downtown.i used to watch a lot of indian movies a long time ago, and what a bliss it was to return to it. i must comment that while i find it hard to listen to indian/hindu speech (it's too fast, and a little harsh for my untrained ears), i find their music beautiful and full of energy. looovee the male singing voices; though the female voices are often lovely in singing, they can sometimes be a little too high pitched. the only big deficit for the movie was the simplistic story line, add to that a very laughable \"romance\" between the wedding planner and the housemaid (though i found both characters thoroughly enjoyable on their own). the movie was far from perfect, but to make up for that, it was thoroughly enjoyable and delightful. highly recommended for anyone looking for a good time.", "i had to watch monsoon wedding and relate it to a text for an english class at university. that assignment turned out to be one of the most fun i've ever had to complete. this is only because of the movie choice. monsoon wedding caused me to feel such a broad spectrum of emotions... happiness, sadness, anger, sympathy... the list goes on. through this movie you get to observe a middle class indian family. one (westerner) would assume that the typical indian family would be quite different from theirs because of all the talk of arranged marriages and other traditions that are seen throughout india. this is not the case. the family in monsoon wedding is very much like a typical western (namely american) family. they laugh together, they argue, they cry together and as a viewer you get to be a part of it all. the bride-to-be has been having an affair with a married man that she works with, and is tormented on whether or not to break it off as well as whether or not to tell her arranged groom-to-be. however, as similar as the family is to a western family, there are all the brightly coloured garments and the sparkling jewelry that is so common in india. traditional indian dancing & song are present as well. in conclusion, monsoon wedding is definitely worth your time. at first the family appears to be extremely different from your own, but then as the movie progresses you realize that they are in fact very similar. they are kinda crazy, but at the end of the day... you have to love them.", "this movie follows the preparations of a wedding in india. the family is spread out all over the world and so the wedding is a homecoming for many of them. it is an arranged marriage and the bride and groom, who have barely met, must work a few things out together. in the background is the slippery p.k dubey who is the wedding planner, and who himself falls for a servant girl. the dialogue and the handling of the various sub plots is superb. in fact the dialogue is so real it feels almost like you are there. the music, by michael danna is stitched seamlessly into the film, but this is not in any way a \"bollywood\" film. a real treat 8/10", "'monsoon wedding' is indeed about a wedding, an arranged marriage for aditi, the daughter of the middle-class vedha family of new delhi, and what happens to them and all the many other people involved in the festivities. you are immediately thrown into their world: noisy, chaotic and an fascinating mixture of indian traditions and western affluence. cellphones and fast cars mix with saris and rickshaws, people effortlessly switch between hindi and english, the groom is a computer programmer from houston, the barman is from melbourne. it's a refreshing look at cosmopolitan modern india, which i tended to either associate with ancient monuments or crowded slums.the planning is an frantic, organised mess, as i imagine preparing for most weddings it. still, things seem to be going well: there is so much laughter, music and colour it is almost impossible not to get dragged into the joy of the occasion. but there are unpleasant secrets beneath the surface. the father is struggling to finance the wedding. the bride is having an affair with a married man. and darker things. the film is full of such contrasts: women delightfully singing a love-song while a lonely servant cleans up, young people flirting while a woman remembers the old terrors, filth lying in city alleys while above the sun sets on the skyline of rose and gold. it is a heady, exuberant mixture of comedy and romance that sometimes threatens to become a tragedy.there is nothing clever about the plot, indeed it could easily have become corny if it was not for the excellence of the acting and the quality of the production. nothing is overplayed. we feel like we are looking into a real world with real people. 'monsoon wedding' is rich in emotion and spectacle, a vibrant and touching film. and, without being explicit, it is also very, very sensuous. you will not regret taking someone you care about to see it.8/10", "after the lacerating \"salaam bombay\", one could be excused for thinking that mira nair had lost her passport to creating a nice little family film. yet for the first couple of reels, she seems to have made just that, as our struggling-to-be-upwardly-mobile family makes preparations for a wedding that is supposed to be perfect but is obviously anything but. i must admit i had difficulty with this part of the film, as the subtitling was patchy and when the actors spoke in english it was sometimes difficult to tell who was speaking and what was being said. this could be a film that improves on repeated viewing.perseverance pays off however. this is a \"family\" film with a finely-honed edge. who could imagine that this seemingly shallow and chaotic family could have a genuine hero as its head in lalit (naseeruddin shah), or that this film could reach across cultures to touch universal themes so effortlessly? or that the dodgy tradesman p.k. (vijay raaz, in a wonderful performance) could combine the earthy humour of shakespeare's rude mechanicals with the soaring romanticism of an urban romeo? tremendous stuff.", "this is a perfect example of what happens when the director is totally confused about what the \"core\" of a story really is.nair probably just glossed over the script sent her way by dhawan. that she has neatly inserted contrived ideas and dead-end sub-plots to keep the action going is of no use. it was unusual how the bride-to-be acted on her impulses the way she did esp. on her wedding night. is that what nubile young girls in indian metros do nowadays? smart observation by nair, eh? totally incredulous by far. the stereotypical depiction of a modern delhi-based punjabi family was insincere and lacked depth. too many punjabi families you know are far from the one shown here.quite frankly, a wedding ceremony is the least likely of all places to explore these fits of fancy. a double implementation of murphy's law by itself would have sufficed to create a subtle plot point or two. there is no such thing however, the events culminate near-perfectly while the phony characters muck around endlessly as instructed by nair.instead of exploring vijay raaz (dubey) character fully and developing that subplot, it is abruptly ended. maybe nair meant monsoon weddings, breakups, romances, scandals etc. but where exactly does one find this patchwork quilt of a group of people called \"verma family\"?? it is real easy to pick up a hi-8 and head to delhi to make monsoon divorce!the film had to sell an \"exotic look and feel\" as there was no real substantive merit to the story. if this is what 'crossover cinema' is all about, its pretty bad. nair, better luck next time.", "mira nair's simple love letter to large families is terrific, filled with wonderful characters and funny situations, the antithesis of robert altman, whose `a wedding' and `dr. t & the women' mined similar territory but in a dysfunctional, exploitive way. like altman's films, there are several storylines running concurrently. here, they surround the arranged marriage in delhi of an upper middle-class girl and the fiancé who has come in from houston for the nuptials. even though each story has some dramatic conflict to it, they're so airy and romantic you never doubt their happy outcomes. (only one, featuring a secret held about the one less-than-sympathetic character, has a resolution that isn't rhapsodic--but even there, it's triumphant.) there's something sweetly naïve about nair's firm belief in the transcendent power of love: she finds it just about everywhere and if it isn't there, she puts it there. lest it all get a little too cloying, nair keeps everything immediate with a hand-held camera that has no problem zooming in for some revealing close-ups; she revels in her characters imperfections and doesn't remain passive--she's like a mother, not above taking sides or chiding those she feels need to be gently reprimanded. her huge cast (there are dozens and dozens of speaking parts) is warm, confident and--though it takes place in an exotic locale--familiar; but it's vijay raaz as the snitty wedding planner humbled by the discovery of true love who steals the show, a heartbreakingly real performance that grows increasingly more powerful as the film progresses. the enthralling musical score is by mychael danna and the colorful production design is by stephanie carroll. stay for the closing credits into which the actual wedding is interspersed--it tells you everything you need to know.", "a drama-comedy giving an idea of the life of a nearly wealthy indian family in new delhi, which contains various elements of the current life of wealthy and economically medium indians. poor people as well as parts of new delhi are only seen in some scenes. the music and photography are fine, and the plot is highly ethic going around a marriage of a young indian lady with another young indian who is living in usa. the film also criticizes in a subtle way prevailing conventionalism in love relationship and other behaviors. india as any other country is under the influence of globalization, and although its population is higher than one billion, part of it living in poor conditions, there is also a large proportion of wealthy people living outside india, who in one way or another influence the changes of the society. in general i was glad to see this material, which gave me some entertainment and new vision of an unknown world.", "thats exactly the feel what i got when i saw the movie.it was so young , lively, fresh energetic.......but so homely.its been more than three years since i attended any marriage but when i saw this movie in my hostel room away from my home it all came back to me.the good thing about the movie is that it makes you feel as if you are no different and you are a part of the family. mira nair captivated on the essence of indian wedding , which is soooo beautiful,this lady has got the mettle and already she has proved it many times.another thing what i liked in the movie is it simplicity none of the scenes were exaggerated and they bring out the best human emotions on screen ,what a delight to watch.the movie represents the contemporary india,just like any other family in the movie too they have their internal problemsit was not a yash chopra genre movie where everything is perfecthuge sets n all and thats where monsoon wedding sets itself apart.in the past few years after hahk bollywood witnessed many marriage oriented movies but monsoon wedding is of a diff league a class cinema. 8.5/10ps:- its very nice to see that so many non indians are also taking interest in the movie.", "i don't mean to suggest that monsoon is not a good film. it is. perhaps it could have been a great film, but it is held back by cinematography of such phenomenally bad proportions that it becomes a severe distraction. i don't know why it is so bad. perhaps they were going for some type of homemade wedding video type style. whatever the case, it was a horrible decision. the camera is almost always hand held, canted, off focus, and too tight. there are some focus pulls that are laughable. the best thing you can say about the camera department is that they kept hair out of the gate. it's too bad for the film, because the story and the acting are top notch.", "it cannot be called a true bollywood movie, but it's a true indian movie, rich with human elements which can be felt by any person. tradition vs modern ways - it's the underlying element knitting the sub-plots together.mira nair's romantic dramedy 'monsoon wedding' has genuine likability value, filled with colour and energy. all the comedy, love, commentary on social issues, and drama are blended well with the music, dance and celebration. mrs. nair knows well how to delicately but gracefully deal with the human elements depicted in the movie. declan quinn's cinematography and mychael danna's score help us to be a part of the festivities.the characters are brutally real, relateable and charming. the unsure bride-to-be who still hasn't gotten over her past relationship, the completely occupied father-of-the-bride dealing with debts and responsibilities, the bored but committed mother trying to find meaning, the usually bad-tongued wedding planner trying to find love, the unmarried cousin still in pain from her childhood molestation trauma - all these and many such characters just fill the story with brimming honesty. the actors have done a brilliant job.", "mira nair's monsoon wedding is about a big upper-middle-class punjabi family who unite for a wedding. the movie is beautifully packaged for a foreign audience... a fact which is well evident in its winning the golden lion at venice earlier this year. on home ground though, the movie almost falls flat on its face.for those living in india, specially the north, the opulence, the ostentatiousness, the ironical paradoxes and most of all, the boisterous happiness of punjabi culture are nothing new. its something we live amongst, something we've come to take for granted. this is nothing that'll enchant an indian audience. so remove the captivating charm of the above, and whats left is a slide-show of tens of ultra familiar characters and their even more familiar relationships.sabrina dhawan's script makes no attempts to go deep into the minds of the characters....though it would make the movie an amazing social documentary for the indian viewer, the international audience would find it too complex a drama. it is full of dry humour and ironical moments. the dialogue is well written, with nobody speaking even a single line out of character. the actors have performed well. my pick among the hordes of actors has to be vijay riyaz as pk dubey. though she appears to be on the verge of being typecast, shefali shetty comes a close second with a strong dramatic role. khulbhushan kharbanda, rajat kapoor, lilette dubey, neha dubey and co. give in satisfactory performances with naseeruddin shah displaying his mastery of the art in the last few minutes. vasundhara das goes through the film with the same i'm-confused-but-what-dyou-think-you-are expression on her face. the musical score, both original and non-original, is brilliant. sukhwinder singh's amazing bhangra composition translates to music the upbeat, high-voltage, jolly mood of the marriage. songs from old hindi movies are used very well to accentuate the emotion prevalent. the background music does a good anough job of making the atmosphere palpable. declan quinn's camera takes you from your viewer's seat into the life of the movie...a feat not many cinematographers can boast of. the hand-held camera floats from one character's life to another's, giving a realistic marriage-video feel.despite quality work the cast and crew, not to forget mira nair's competent direction skills, what lets down the native viewer is a script exclusively packaged for a foreign audience.6/10", "this was an excellent film, along the plot line of east is east that came out a few years ago. monsoon wedding however is more authentic to the indian culture and contains more lifelike characters. this is a movie that you should save for a rainy day and one that will entice you back to see it a second time.", "a great deal of the movie had the feel of a family getting together for a wedding, with someone just filming the mundane goings on around the family house. of course, there was a lot going on! but a great deal of wasn't particularly dramatic, but rather ordinary conflicts. the wedding is hectic, the guests are arriving... the plans have to be finalized... things cost more than expected... a few minor squables break out that are resolved quickly.i found the sideline story of the infatuation of the event planner, dubey, with the kitchen helper, alice, to be the most interesting part of the movie. dubey got to show several sides of his personality, and when you noticed the fast talking event planner showing an interest in alice you see that while he wasn't at a loss for words in his business dealings, that the words were a struggle around the attractive alice.all in all the story seemed pretty routine. it was satisfying, but not particularly dramatic, as things went pretty much according to plan. this movie was kind of an indian version of \"father of the bride\", with a little less comedy, and more drama.", "maybe it's my problem, but i can never understand the professional knockers, the ones who can't enjoy a fun movie because in some ways it fails to live up to their superior artistic sensitivities.i thoroughly enjoyed monsoon wedding, and as it wound towards its conclusion felt it had managed to give some profound insights into the dilemmas created when east meets west and the old traditions become suddenly challenged by new social norms. the lovely sweet romance between pk and alice was so delicately portrayed, and the crisis confronting the father on the wedding day was superbly handled. he showed himself to be a better man than our current governor general!", "i didn't really like this. it's about a family in delhi, india getting ready for their daughter's wedding. all the relatives gather and things go spinning out of control. it's supposed to be funny (i think) but i wasn't laughing--neither was anyone else in the theatre.for starters--the cast was huge--way too many people. i'm still not sure who was who's cousin or whatever. as a comedy this is pretty grim. it's more of a serious drama than anything else. also the cast keeps switching back and forth between indian (there are subtitles) and heavily accented english (no subtitles). often they do it in the middle of conversations! it gets annoying and confusing.however it is very colorful (including the opening and closing credits), the cast is just great (there are some very attractive men and women in it) and it is interesting to see how another culture celebrates a wedding. but the little dramas that happen have been done before and end very predictably. more often than not, i was bored. i knew how the stories would work out and i was always right. the acting kept me watching.slight spoiler ahead!!!!!!! also, i find it more than a little disturbing that they worked child molestation into the plot. it's treated seriously, but do you really want to see that in a comedy? so, i'm giving it a 6 for the color, acting, gorgeous people and some nice, assured direction by mira nair...but i didn't really like it.", "i agree with an earlier reviewer. the script for this film seems to have been created with a cookie cutter, with the writer concocting the familiar shapes of stereotypical characters we've seen many times before. the result is film in which the actors speak their lines and then listen for their cues so they can speak again. for all the action, there is very little interaction. bad writing undercuts the ability of the characters to generate any compelling drama.the director seems very competent, though, and i think we can expect better work when better scripts become available.", "for me the movie came with a lot of hype, a venice golden lion award, golden globe nomination ... mira nair's film, an accomplished cast and so on. the one thing i constantly heard was that the movie was full of fun and frolic and a joyful watch. contrary to that i thought that monsoon wedding despite its pomp and gaeity, colour and charm, music and sound, was one of the most melancholic movies ive ever seen. the entire movie is laced with the flavor of pathos. it shows how despite the obvious and the superfluous the agony, the indecision, the difficulties, the trauma that lies behind arranged indian marriages.the movie though suffers from an overdose of sexual tension. every character seems to have some problems in this regard. i also felt that some very serious issues were lightly touched upon and easily brushed away. and there really isnt much of a \"plot\" in a conventional sense. the ending is also quite cliched in a \"bollywood\" way.despite these flaws, the movie scores thanks to some brilliant acting especially by shefali shetty and vijay raaz. a good watch, just not a simple or easy movie. i found it pretty disturbing in many ways.in all, a compact 8!", "this was an excellent film and it's a terrific place to start for anyone who has never seen india's traditional \"bollywood\" cinema. all of the traditional devices are there: dance sequences, singing (although the two lovers do not sing to each other), parallel loves between two rich persons and two poor persons. what made the film outstanding was (1) the mixture of india and \"india abroad\" and (2) scenes showing the \"clash\" between the poverty on the streets and the lower class homes and the jangling of traditional ceremonies and modern values -- from fancy night clubs to racy behavior among the younger generation. it's a real treat -- and it's reality to boot.but 8, not 10. the sound mix made it hard to pick up some the english with the india accents, especially at the beginning of the film.", "the obvious precedent for 'monsoon wedding' is robert altman's 'a wedding'; both are sprawling, multi-character films about the wedding of two wealthy, but culturally distinct families. but in spite of a sub-plot focused on child abuse, 'monsoon wedding' lacks the satirical, bleak edge of its predecessor: the rich, it seems to say, are just the people we ourselves would like to be. given that the film is set in india, a society of immense inequality of wealth, i found its straightforward celebration of the lives of the affluent a little odd; and hard to care for its characters who seemed to own lives free of the constraints that not only bind most people, but which are also the stuff of real drama. the movie is lively, colourful, and musical; but i found it hard to really care.", "well... i was at first very skeptical about this indian movies. they are usually not my cup of tea. i wasn't suppose to watch this movie but i was asked by my dad. i have to tell u i have never enjoyed an indian movie like that. this movie is so lovable, the people are so real by maintaining their indian identity and really trying to connect you to them and make u understand where the mentality of the bollywood industry comes from.", "although india is still one of the few countries by in large able to cultivate their cultural and social heritage, the ever-pressing influence of the so-called modern \"western\" civilization takes its toll - superficially, this is not at all that negative, even though it promotes a lifestyle that is by far unsustainable and should therefore be critically questioned and analyzed. unfortunately it is just a comedy, thus unable to convey this message to the viewing public.", "in no way is this film a traditional indian movie. this is a good thing for me cause i'm not to big on those bollywood rain-dancing, song-singing, running-through-the-forest, type flicks.this movie had none of that traditional, formulatic, indian movie stuff. it's done in a \"western\" style with chracters that could actually exist in real life.what i liked:it touched issues that are rarely explored in bollywood films, such as homosexuality, and child abuse.i actually found the one sub-plot with the servents falling in love to be quite more interesting than the main story of the bride and groom to be. there are also alot of fit females in this movie, including alot of t&a shaking. and the music was great...especially that drum and bass lic. what sucked:now, this movie isn't all good. i thought there was a bit too much sub-plots and sub-chracters going on to keep track of, and i also found that the bride and groom fell in love wayyyy too fast (probably a result of their courting time being eaten up by the subs).overall:it was a refreshing change from the typical-predictable-garbage that bollywood spits out, and india chews up. and the girls were great (especially alice).i want to see more flicks like this- modern, but still indian.7/10", "a movie about the wedding habits of the upper-class indian couples. and about love of course. a movie full of passion, music, dance, joy and sadness, as well. the huge cousinhood is present at the bride's house, making the preparations for the big event, the wedding. everyone has his/her own little secret. the bride, the cousin, the sister and even the head of the family, having financial problems. love is everywhere, especially during the monsoon-time. even the low-class indians have their touching love story (between the maidservant and the guy supervising the preparation for the wedding). all these events happen is a very indian atmosphere, you can see the swirl of new delhi, the atmosphere of an indian market or wedding. the monsoon rain cannot ruin the mirth of the wedding party, it just gives an indian flavor to it.", "it looks pretty and has some magical moments, but in the end feels like a really well done sitcom. except for one plot line which is way too dark and unnecessary for the movie, it's light fluff with a different flavor. nothing to write home about.", "interesting and enjoyable for the little insight it gives into indian culture despite a non-original story. from the first scene one can guess that there is going to be 'problems' or at least a small scandal with the bride and one of the guest, that a love story will start with another, and that one will become a responsible man. so nothing really special, nothing really new, but still enjoyable to watch even if there are some pathetic moments of indecision.this movie is like if india was discovering itself. it is nice for a country to realise - after everybody else did - that indians are not perfect and are human like us. that despite the laziness of the men and their machismo they are weak and highly dependent on women. it is unusual to watch these proud pathetic men doing miserable schemes to themselves and their relatives.women on the contrary appear strong and knows what they want. they are more in touch with the reality and the changing of their world. but still they are confined to house keeping tasks.a nice insight into 21st century india trying to evolve from its 17th century social constraints despite earning $ the hard way in the usa and australia.", "movies about weddings certainly have recurring themes; tensions among and between the bride and groom's families, the odd family skeleton popping out, trouble with the caterers, and various romantic sub-plots, but of course the main dramatic tension is always will they/ won't they make it to the altar (or its local equivalent). weddings as depicted on screen are usually bright, noisy chaotic affairs - `my best friend's wedding,' `four weddings and a funeral,' `muriel's wedding' for example - and this movie is no exception. two young punjabis from affluent family backgrounds (though her dad is hurting a bit) are proceeeding to an arranged marriage despite the fact that he is resident in the us and apparently thoroughly westernised. they have at least met, and like each other, but she is carrying on an affair with a local (delhi) tv host. the family have gathered from all over the world to celebrate, and determined to celebrate they are, despite the monsoon weather. actually, no-one minds getting wet, for it seems a wet bride is a happy one.watching the movie with a partly indian audience gave a different perspective to it all  there was great hilarity when one character says `now speak english; it shows you are a refined person', and when the event organiser dubey ( a gem of a performance from vijay raaz), his suggestion of white for the marquee rebuffed by the bride's father, tells his men, `ok, put up the old colours' (which turn out to be brilliant orange and red). as an outsider, one can only guess at some of the nuances, but there is enough in common here for at least affluent westerners to relate to (the poor are not able to worry about the colour of the marquee). strangely enough the most affecting relationship was that struck up between the bride's family's servant, the beautiful alice, and the surprisingly shy dubey, who despite organising 150 weddings, has yet to get married himself. here love blooms despite all the social constraints.the noise, number of characters and mira nair's altman-style direction make this is a somewhat confusing movie to watch, and even at the end i hadn't worked out exactly who was related to who. however you do get the general idea. a family able to benefit from globalisation is maintaining its individual culture as best it can. and an arranged marriage is not necessarily an anachronism  why should a dating agency be able to do any better than the traditional family procedures? the so-called `love match' is often a result of friends conspiring to bring a couple together, and the sort of arrangement depicted here is clearly one between volunteers. the music, singing and dancing is well integrated into the story and although there's a lot of noise, it's generally easy to listen and watch for the 115 minutes it takes mira nair to paint her cross-cultural picture of a universal happy event.", "hi guys its an extremely awesome movie with binding scripts good cinematography, great performances, realistic touches to indian marriage. its an extremely good movie yet so simple to understand. the performances by naseeruddin shah, lilit dubey and everybody is so real and excellent that i would rather watch this movie ten times in a row than watching another crossover flick for one time. well its evident that the movie is filled with some hard abusive language and some sexual talks and references but its a part of this movie you wont feel odd while watching this movie with your parents and family. folks its a great movie with great performance good camera work, mind grabbing background music. its worth your money nearly perfect. a 9/10 flick", "\"monsoon wedding\" splatters the screen with ebullience as a very westernized east indian couple and throngs of family members in new delhi convene for that universally most happy of occasions. a fun and festive flick with all manner of family issues expressed in and among the wedding preparations, this plotless film is a delightful hodgepodge of busy goings-on full of handsome folks in anxious anticipation the festivities. a delightful \"happening\", \"monsoon wedding\" will score best with viewers into foreign films or with a specific interest in east indian culture. (b-)", "as a delhi family prepares to celebrate its daughter's wedding to an expatriate indian living in canada, the secret tensions, desires and histories of its members are gradually revealed as either endearing or dysfunctional - but always credible.it would be foolish to pigeonhole nair as an 'ethnic' director - her films are about families, relationships and culture, and they are universal.'monsoon wedding' brings all these themes together, across sexes, generations, classes and continents. complex characters become accessible, moments of joy, humour and sadness weave together a picture of life which is rooted in the colour and customs of india, but speaks to the experience of all of us. and the audience's journey between the parents, lovers and children of this superlative ensemble cast encompasses a range of life less extreme than 'salaam bombay, perhaps, but one which reflects the greater opportunities of today's globalised culture while preserving the structural constraints of poverty and patriarchy.touches of bollywood - part of the fantastic soundtrack - highlight the power of myth, music and makeup to act out intense personal and communal truths. anyone who can leave this film unmoved needs to look hard at their own emotional health.", "movies are said to be an enormous industry in india. probably it is much superior to hollywood in quantity and the indians love to watch their films. \"monsoon wedding\" is well worth seeing. it is about an arranged wedding, but it's not arranged it that tyrannical way you learn about in some countries. this is not an uncomplicated thing however, not among the upper middle class, which we meet here. the indian family is not an uncomplicated institution, and especially not in this film, where we meet a pedofile and the drama concerning the loyalty towards him.this movie is dark (and) funny, touching and full of colours. one wanders however if this is the version that has been showed in india or if this is the \"western\"-cut? we can understand this film without difficulty, although it is dealing with a quite different culture. would we understand the version showed in india that easy?", "i loved this movie! the first reviewer did such a good job, i won't bother going on and on (well, okay, just a bit.) it was a very human movie. but i gave it an eight rather than a ten because i thought it pandered to 'hollywood' a tad too much. the pedophile ... too much over the top. too 'hollywood writer cr*p'. the girl making out in the car with her married lover... same thing. maybe it's a bollywood thing.... bollywood hollywood, perhaps they are more alike than not.however, the scene where the 'good' uncle makes the 'bad' uncle (and his wife) leave... so very human, and such a very human handling of the 'bad uncle's' behavior. if this film had been made by hollywood rather than bollywood, the 'bad uncle' would have been arrested, but first he would have been beaten to a pulp by the young girl's 'kinfolk'. probably better that it is a bollywood film -- not quite so predictable.the dubay guy... you start out disliking him and then he sees alice... badabing go the strings of his heart, and then suddenly he has a different face.... he's someone you can imagine loving. amazing transformation.this movie is a woman's movie, for sure. i must run now, and tell all my women friends about it.", "my only knowledge of this film before seeing it was that it had won a golden lion at venice. and for that, i was slightly surprised at what the film offered.it was great fun, make no mistake. in a packed house on a bargain-priced night, the laughs were many and they were shared.but the film rarely seemed to rise above the level of simple soap opera. the resolution of the most dramatic issue in the film seemed convenient and almost trite. i would echo other comments above that note there is little here by the way of plot.but leaving that aside, it's colourful, it's warm, it's funny and you could do a lot worse. the 'crazy credit' right at the end was just the best finale to an, on the whole, enjoyable film.", "if you watch this film, do not be put off by the relative slow pace in the first portion of the movie. all this is necessary to help create the characters as they are slowly introduced. however, through the course of the movie, they are imbued with amazing depth and real-life problems and triumphs. it is amazing to see this unfold and by the film's conclusion, i was a great fan of this film. if i were to try to describe it, i would agree with my daughter who saw it as a movie much like my big fat greek wedding, but with some much more serious aspects. and it is true, because through the course of the film you come to really care about the people and it can't help but touch your heart.fyi--due to some language and adult themes, this movie would not be appropriate for young children, though should be fine for teens. my own 15 year-old daughter watched it with me and enjoyed it as much as i did.", "i heard a lot of good things about this movie, so i decided to watch it. however, it is quite ordinary. i don't see what the big fuss about it. indian movies are good at songs and dances, however, this one has very few. and for the guy who worked as the wedding planner, i don't see how easily he can just fall in love with the maid who worked in the house in such a short time. that is so unreal. and this is the 21st century, why can't they find someone in different social backgrounds to fall in love with? is india still a society with classes? and for the rest of the story, it is just so common, and predictable.", "the movie presents the wedding traditions in upper class india. if you are interested in learning many things about the wedding in india: costumes, music,traditions then you should see this movie. otherwise the movie is very boring. one would expect that such a talented director would use a little creativity. but unfortunately the movie is just a real slice of life; no deep thoughts; nothing to stimulate your imagination. as a documentary this movie deserves many accolades. but we did not want to see a documentary, did we?", "very few movies include you. most movies keep you away, you are distantly watching, wondering if you will be included. this movie invites you into the lives of this family. you experience the highs and lows with them. the intimate moments with a husband and wife in bed together, his vulnerability completly exposed, it's beautiful. i loved the music so much i ran out and bought the soundtrack. the music is perfectly placed and created an exciting wedding feel. weddings aren't always happy and perfect, how can they be when the whole family is together. drama and caos always follow. but it's nice to know that happiness prevails. i loved this movie and can't wait to own it.", "i've purchased two copies of this movie. it will touch your heart and stir your soul. this movie will introduce a beautiful, complicated, and complex culture. the filming and directing is superb. words cannot fully describe this beautiful movie as it touches on so many aspects of humanity without being offensive. the movie leads the viewer on a journey through india's character, class, and culture. this movie educates as well as it entertains. i would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in customs and traditions of cultures other than one's own. this movie addresses marriage, family, falling in love and the hurts and joys which make it all worth while.", "set in present day delhi, this comedy-drama focuses on the punjabi verma family, who are about to celebrate their daughter's marriage. with days to go, admist the chaotic final preparations, and arrival of the extended family, secrets of the various members of the familt threaten to derail the proceedings.like in salaam bombay and missisipi masala, nair continues her directoral passion for tackling difficult issues. i consider this her best work because in monsoon wedding she is able to tackle these issues within the framework of an overall feel-good movie. her characters tackle their problems openly and honestly resulting in a fresh believable social drama. the family serves as a micro vehicle for india - like the country, the family is in a stage of transition -great work of art and a very well executed depiction of chaotic diverse modern india.", "this movie was the greatest movie i have ever seen. i hate to be typical, but i laughed and i cried. i felt such a connection with that family. it was so wonderful. i love the actors... especially some of the male young actors. it was so funny. i love the \"idiot\" saying all through out the movie. i don't know what else to write. go see this work of art!!!", "have you ever seen a film that seems like it was taken at your own sister or brother (or any other family member's) wedding? for those looking forward to a raw piece of cinema that doesn't deal with the world's hardships in connotations of the wrongs this world has done to us, but the reality in each of our lives, mira nair gives us monsoon wedding, all that and more. watching monsoon wedding will identify an indian person's nri lives with at least, at least, one memory of their life. perhaps one they cherish or one they loath to think of, but certainly monsoon wedding affirms the fact that a \"raw\" real film can be made without having to stoop to run of the mill bollywood standards, and without leaving the norms of a normal film.shah, shefali and rajat kapoor give amazing performances and we see the character and not a single trait of the person in the whole movie.", "i really, really liked this film. i've seen a lot of good movies lately, and this one surely makes it to the top of the list. what i especially liked is the no-nonsense telling of the sub-plots. the movie just touches the plots here and there in a very well edited way, all cumulating to the end which is mostly focussed on the excellent actor who plays the father of the bride. i won't say anything about the stories, but one thing that struck me is that in my view this is more a drama, though brought light-hearted in parts, than it is a comedy. i'm still wondering what comedy aspects there are in this movie. anyway: go see this movie!!", "started promising, but feels like an incomplete documentary more than fictional movie... no identifiable main characters with fully developed stories, but rather dozens of secondary characters that are partially developed and don't have a strong connection to the audience. more of a character study than a movie with a forward-moving plot. some mini-sub-plots make minor progress, but all of the above had me not caring. too many featured characters dilutes what little story there is.", "in monsoon wedding director mira nair expertly knits together a joyous, sprawling story about a wedding, an affair, and a love-sick wedding planner. nair is aiming her camera at life in modern day india, but still holds onto many of the traditions of bollywood filmmaking. monsoon wedding is full of life  interesting characters, bright swirling colours, fabulous indian music  and like one of nair's previous efforts, the oscar nominated salaam bombay, seems poised to break through the cultural marketplace and become a mainstream north american hit. also check out the marvellous score by winnipeg-born mychael danna.", "monsoon wedding is a perfectly entertaining and informative movie which is a must see for all the indians and for all those people who are even slightly interested in the indian culture.this movie depicts an almost perfect picture of settled marriages and life in general of higher middle class families in the indian sub-continent. it entertains the viewers by demonstrating the different incidents-- both sweet and sad,which happen in the background during the ongoing ceremony.also, this movie disproves the common fear that is prevalent in the western culture regarding the concept of settled marriages. although it is true that sometimes settled marriages are forced and can cause trouble for the couple, but this movie shows that settled marriages are not done forcibly all the time, but in fact, increasingly nowadays, this is a system where parents select the guy/girl at the same time giving them a leeway to make their own choice.overall, this movie is a mix of romance, drama, little bit of tragedy and a lot of humor, and not to mention, glamour caused mainly by the famous modern-indian dances, songs/events and by the presence of the beautiful indian girls on their charming outfits and their interaction with the handsome indian guys throughout.", "as i sat in the theater, i laughed, cried and tapped my foot to the music. i absolutely loved it! the music is amazing, the cast top-notch, and the beauty of it was unbelievable. i give the director a 10 for her unique way of showing life in india. the colors were vibrant and wonderful. after seeing this movie twice, i definitely recommend it to anyone. all i can say now is bravo!", "the plot is a little predictable, but the actors do such a fine job with their parts that you'll hardly mind knowing what's coming. there are no less than five storylines being woven together around the central wedding, but it's dubey's love story that stands out and grabs the viewer's attention. his relationship with alice is so quiet, gentle, understated that you can't help getting involved and wishing them happiness.even if you manage to remain uninterested in the many plotlines, mira nair has created a visual and auditory masterpiece. the film's color scheme is bright--reds, purples, golds, and the profuse number of marigolds gives an almost tactile sensation. the soundtrack is amazing too, perfectly suited to the mood of every scene.", "this was one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. the acting was superb, the camera work was flawless, the music was enchanting, the story was touching, and the characters were easy to fall in love with. this was a great look into the culture of a traditional punjabi family living in modern times. also, the way they switched back & forth from english to punjabi was an interesting touch- it made the experience even better! mira nair is truly an artist!", "i didn't really have any idea what i was going in to see, other than something about a wedding with the possibility of rain involved. i'm pretty worn out on formula hollywood pictures and was eager to drop some dough and elected to see another foreign film i knew little about. deep characters, believable failabilities, jarring music with a stirring beat, costumes, dance, and wultiple stories intertwine and intersect in an nice finale. needless to say, i was a deer trapped in the headlights, before this grand spectacle, watching it continually unfold. as pleased as i was with amelie, i was more-so with monsoon wedding. both will find immediate space in my collection, to be seen again and again.", "i can enjoy a film with subtitles. i can enjoy a film even when i have to strain to understand the english spoken with foreign accents.however a film that goes from subtitles to hard to understand english in the same sentence is almost impossible for me to follow. all of a sudden the subtitles disappear and by the time i have adjusted to the heavily accented english i've missed 2 or 3 sentences.maybe others do not have this problem. i understand that this switching between languages actually occurs in india. but for me it just killed the film.", "monsoon wedding directed by mira nair is a film about an india family marriage. this film is one of the most effective examples of an india family ever put on screen. it displays events ranging form delightful to serious and appalling situations. the two families are about to collide when aditi is promised to marry hemant. the young couple meets for the first time properly at their own engagement party and they are left with only a few days to get to know each other before there big wedding. this movie, taking place where the indians speak both english and hindi captures much excitement and energy as we get to know the whole extended family. family members form both sides have traveled from both america and australia to join in wit he celebration. aditi's mother and father have a lot to do and their family and friends make it to be more complicated then it actually is. aditi's father is excited about the wedding and you see him throughout the movie very frustrated and nervous trying to get everything ordered and perfectly arrange for his daughters wedding. the biggest problem is aditi is currently having an affair with a married co-worker that sends a twist right before the wedding. the four-day arrangements and celebrations help show some of the indian wedding traditions. you see family parties, drama, lot's of music and dancing and a new romance for dubey the wedding planner and the household maid, alice.the great filmmaking and the use of hand held captures camera scenes is an important setting in the movie. the hand- held camera movements give the movie a sense of a more documentary style film. with frequent arm limbs in the shootings you are able to capture a better sense of this. the use of combining the traditional american family style marriage with the traditional indian style marriage gives this movie style by playing around with these differences and letting the audience see the differences. in the movie dubey starts putting up a white tent to display a more american traditional wedding but to the indian dad white is meant for a funeral and he demands a color tent consisting of reds and oranges.with combinations of warmth and laughter, music and dance, romance and serious problems, director mira nair has made this movie a family entertainment.", "simply put: this is the best movie i've seen this year. its full of life and color. you leave the movie with a huge gaping smile. a tough project to take on but nair does an absolutely wonderful job.", "as the director often emphasises, this film is a work of love. we feel her love for the bollywood film, for her characters, for india, in every scene. true to tradition, this movie has all the components of the genre: comedy, drama, family traditions and conflicts, song and dance, and, obviously, love. events revolve around the title wedding, which will be celebrated dangerously close to the monsoon season, and feature the not so blushing bride, who still has a thing for a married man (this is modern india, you know), the arranged husband, both their very extensive families, as well as the touching story between the guy who does wedding decorations and catering for a living without ever getting married himself, and one of the servant girls of the house. things start to complicate themselves as the rains begin and the bride elopes to have a late night tryst with her lover, where they get into a spot of trouble with the police. also, the family members living in india clash with those living in more \"relaxed\" environments (such as australia and the states) over the mandates of tradition, while the father of the bride despairs of the slowness with which the work of the wedding-planner and his associates progresses. as difficult as things may seem, though, everything turns out well. mira nair handles her large cast with affection and insight, and is not afraid of touching a very delicate and taboo-fraught issue on the way with just the right measure of drama. you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll realise that bollywood shows you life as it should be: a celebration, even when it's raining.", "this is a great movie. wonderful insight into the modern, global, indian world - and families of every culture. shot with innovation and intelligence. great story that is both funny and poignant. by the same director as mississippi massala.", "i must admit that this movie is a very realistic view on india habits + lifestyle + mentality and even the indian english, the houses and the streets - everything in all its details make me feel present in india!!!! (and i have been there quite some times, usually spending months, and having many friends there and thus witnessing from nearby indian life and participating in it)i love the honesty of this picture, how film director mira nair is depicting the different cultural values. he don't try to give a better impression of indian life than reality is, although himself being indian!!! (many people would hang-up from their country a better picture than it is) the different characters are very well depicted and bring all this to a vivid painting.and even from cinematographic aspect this movie is great. the colors, decoration, house setting and actor's expressions are well portraying the reality.only over-classed by the less known movie samsara of pan nalin. but many western and bollywood movies score much less than monsoon wedding!!!", "take a kaleidoscope of the brightest pure colours, add the most amazing \"over the top\" characters, sprinkle liberally with tears and laughter and you have the recipe for this film which is a delightful feast for all the senses. there is so much happening all the time that you become fearful that something might be missed, trying to see into every corner of every scene which is almost impossible! well worth the price of a ticket and might even warrant a second viewing, this film deserves a much wider distribution than it will receive. definitely 10/10.", "mira nair has not the psychological insight to deliver us an indian movie which shows us a wedding in the american way as robert altman did in wedding, a (1978). her characters are all superfluous. i know nothing of the way of life in india but it seems that a wedding is a serious celebration. when the fiancée is engaged with a person and has to confess that she has a relationship with a guy from television than normally there is no wedding! apparently indian people want to celebrate first and think later. a peculiar scene is when the most venerated member of the family is send away because he is kissing the very young daughter of the house. i did also not understand if in india there is something like social classes, everybody seems to make love with anyone of their first choice. also it was not easy to understand if this family is rich or not and what is their social status. from this point of view after all a confusing movie for westerners.", "this film is an absolute gem of a motion picture. dragged to this film i went kicking and screaming. i didn't want to see some sappy love movie. however upon viewing this marvelous motion picture, i realized the importance of such culturally diverse films. i had a wonderful time, full of laughing and a slight tear or two. anyone with a taste for quality in story and plot will love this movie. p.s. there is not that much subtitle to read so don't fret and enjoy the show!", "i had the extreme pleasure to have free passes to see the movie, monsoon wedding. i probably could count the number of foreign films i have seen on one hand, but if this movie is any representation of what i've been missing, i'm gonna start working on my other hand and both feet :-). this movie out of india was unbelievably entertaining. it involves what goes on in the planning of a wedding. it is was so interesting to see what goes on in another country in this tradition. there are many sub plots involved in this wedding. the father of the bride having a difficult time monetarily putting this together yet trying his best to do what he has to do to see that his daughter's pre arranged marriage goes through to her american fiancee. there are more than monetary obstacles involved, the daughter just happens to be having an affair with a married man and is having trouble letting go. there is also a wonderful love story blooming (pun intended since marigolds play a major role in the movie) between the wedding planner and one of the house keepers. there are many characters we see in this movie and many are given good story lines. there is a young son with a very adult identity crisis he is dealing with, and a niece with a hidden family secret which could destroy the family unit. there are some wonderful scenes showing the planning of the wedding, such as shopping through the fabric stores for garments for the wedding party. then we are taken through some very traditional rites of passage for the bride to be. some filled with music, dancing and laughter, some very tender sentiments. this movie will make you laugh (some parts of dubbed, but pay attention to translations), cry, tug at your heart and will keep your attention throughout the entire movie. you will not be bored. this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. this will not be a major release so you may have to search around to find out where it is playing ..... it is worth the search to see a family other than one's we are used to seeing in most movies. the background music is quite interesting, you will hear traditional east indian music and singing, and all of a sudden a mix of east indian and disco for some of the wedding scenes. costumes are so beautiful and very colorful. out of 4 stars, i will give it the full 4 plus !!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "having actually attended an extravagantly huge and eye-opening hindu/christian wedding here in the states, i got a big kick out of mira nair's beautifully layered and colorful altmanesque \"monsoon wedding.\" the fact that she followed this up with the excellent hbo \"women on the verge of a nervous breakdown in 1980's new jersey\" film \"hysterical blindness\" is proof positive that she is in the prime of her directing career and is an international artist to watch for in the near future.upper-middle class modern day indian culture is brought to a vibrant and beautiful life here in the hands of nair. this film has everything you want in a multi-generational comedy/drama: dark family secrets, culture clash, generation gap, unabashed romances, infidelity, and enough family drama to fuel an entire season of a day-time soap opera. it's a bit confusing at first as the film alternates between subtitles and heavily accented spoken english, but once you get acclimated to the culture and lost in the lush scenery, you'll get sucked into this delicious family affair that culminates in a rain-soaked wedding of epic celebratory proportions.", "monsoon wedding: representative of a changing society contemporary views have struggled in the battle with traditional ways in new delhi, india. this concept most aptly seen in one of india's largest markets, cinema, has dramatically impacted society. monsoon wedding, a highly acclaimed film by mira nair is the epitome of a changing culture in india. the movie summarizes a punjabi family whom is brought together for an arranged marriage. the foremost problem with the family gathering is the difference in opinions between the parents and the generation that ensue them. this film is not only representative of india and its struggle between the dot-com era and more traditional views but of an entire genre of movies that have adapted to benefit in changing times. over the past few years if a festival were not handing out awards for a patriotic and propaganda filled war film then it was beseeched with praise from a distraught and broken down family struggling to make ends meet with a bizarre twist of an ending.case-and-point 8 mile, a film which faired very well at last weeks academy awards portrayed the epitome a broken family. to think that just 30-40 years ago shows such as `the brady bunch' and `the partridge family' dominated the airwaves. divorce and domestic violence claiming a much greater abundance in today's society have become capitalized and marketed much like a late night infomercial, pounded over-and-over into the brain of society. the lifestyle in these films are still not acceptable but rather tolerated with the conclusive idea that something bright might be attainable at the end of the tunnel. betrayal, abuse, & adultery have become fixations on representing what occurs in a typical family. this saddens the hearts of few but merely is entertainment for the masses that gather around the television or voyage out for a saturday matinee. cinema that represent this negative aspect in society are not faulty nor the causation of what in actuality it does portray, but rather a strategic marketing tool for success in the film industry. reluctance does not falter at the idea that cinema is trying to display a reality found in society but rather the need for audiences to view this over-dramatic representation of their own lives. sickeningly, i'll be first in line with a bag of popcorn in my hand.", "mira nair, thank you. thank you so very much. the mess of life,the joy of living, the confusion of being alive! i saw salaambombay so many years ago. i've seen pather panchali. aparajito. the life of apu.you know, i am reminded of do the right thing, your coloursexplode in a joyfull expression of life.i do not wait to be asked. i tell them that monsoon wedding isextraordinary, i will rent it twice, i will buy it. it is exactly what ibelieve in when i talk about cinema. mira nair, i cannot thank you enough.", "it's a shame really, that not more people have heard of this film. i've been doing my best to spread the word of mouth. this is a sweet little movie with beautiful scenery and lots of characters to try and remember. this is one you need to see more than once! i left the theater feeling as if i knew this family and wanted to be part of them. loved the side love story between the wedding coordinator and the housemaid. i loved \"my big fat greek wedding\", but of the two wedding movies i saw in 2002, i give this one the edge. both were wonderful films, but this one had a little more substance to it. i highly recommend it.", "monsoon wedding tells the story of a big, modern family and its struggles. at first glance, one may think the story is about aditi verma's (vasundhara das) wedding, but on closer inspection, we can see there's so much more. the film talks about themes such as homosexuality, extra-marital relations, conservative indian values, grooming and sexual abuse, and so much more.director mira nair captured the big family atmosphere to perfection. with a million things going on at any given moment and people talking over each other. with family being the main theme of the film it's worth noting that while the film starts in pure chaos, it ends in harmony, as it happens with family.as to be expected from a bollywood film the soundtrack is amazing. it includes 19 different songs, with around an hour in length. all but 4 songs were composed by mychael danna.a beautiful drama worth a watch, or ten.", "...which isn't necessarily a bad thing, cinematically speaking. as she did in the masterpiece \"salaam bombay,\" nair immerses the viewer in a milieu at once exotic and familiar, inhabited by characters who are achingly real in their situations and their natural development. the handheld camera-work which seems so artificially stylistic in the dogme-hands is nothing but an extension of the viewer in nair's seemingly effortless control. even setting aside the wonderful character development-- the color, the music and dancing, the teeming cities and lush suburbs display india in all her richness and contrast. i felt a real sense of elation at the end of this film (don't forget to watch all the end credits!), even as i joked to my companion \"if i never see another orange flower, it won't be too soon!\"", "many actors started their journey with this film and i am lucky to see them on screen till date, art has the power to freeze time i can always visit delhi in 2001 thank you all who made this film possible love and peace.", "i rarely leave a movie feeling as drained and disappointed as i did after watching monsoon wedding. if ever there was a film that tried too hard to be something it's not, this is it. from start to finish, monsoon wedding is a chaotic mess, failing to deliver on any front-be it story, character development, or emotional engagement.the plot, if you can even call it that, is a meandering jumble of clichés and half-baked subplots that go nowhere. the film desperately attempts to capture the essence of a grand indian wedding, but what we get instead is a disjointed series of events that feel forced and contrived. there's no real flow or coherence to the narrative, and by the end, i was left wondering what the point of it all was.now, let's talk about the writing-or rather, the lack thereof. the dialogue is stiff, awkward, and painfully unoriginal. the characters, who could have been rich and complex, are instead reduced to shallow stereotypes. it's almost as if the writers didn't care to develop their motivations or backstories, leaving us with a cast of cardboard cutouts who are impossible to relate to or care about.i also have to question the competence of the writers. how could anyone think that this script was ready for production? the pacing is off, the transitions are jarring, and the attempts at humor fall flat. it feels like a rough draft that somehow made it to the big screen without anyone bothering to refine it. it's a shame, really, because the premise had potential, but it's squandered by lazy writing and a complete lack of direction.in conclusion, monsoon wedding is a colossal waste of time. it's a film that could have been charming and heartwarming, but instead, it's a boring, uninspired mess. save yourself the trouble and skip this one-it's not worth a second of your time.", "`just because a romantic comedy is indian doesn't make it any better', i thought to myself. and as i came in to the movie, i was very stubborn about liking it, but eventually it won me over. but for the last minutes of the movie i couldn't help but smiling. monsoon wedding did so many things right i don't know where to begin. first, the characters; there are so many characters in this movie that it seems impossible to make them work without being contrived stereotypes. maybe some people saw them like this, but i really felt like they were fleshed out well. we don't need an hour of screen time to develop a character when you can learn so much from a glance or a single line. for example when the pedophile uncle first makes an appearance, the look on both his and ria's faces let you know exactly what is going on. this could go either way of course, it could be that we know what's going on because we have seen the same thing countless times on lifetime, but i give the benefit of the doubt to mw and say that it is just superbly done acting and editing. we get the same feeling with the initial meetings of dubey and alice. the painful awkwardness and obvious tension between them feels excruciatingly authentic. throughout the film we see very small scenes and pieces of dialogue that tell so much. we spend very little time with many of the characters but we feel like we know their whole lives. the relationship between the bride and her ex lover when they meet in the car, the friendship between the mother and her sister as they remember their honeymoons, the background of the australian, the obnoxious uncle, etc. there are so many people in this film, but they all come together and we get a feel for all of the characters which is very hard to pull together when there are so many people. the same technique that we familiarize ourselves with the characters is used to tell other details. the direct conflict between old/new and east/west in india is very prominent, but it is entirely understated. the scene on the golf course, the argument over the wedding tent, the music, the mobile phones, the drinks, the clothes, it all blends together to make one interesting cocktail. i think one reason the film endeared itself to me was its shear beauty. the colors are so vibrant and lively, and the shots are composed so artfully. some of my favorites were when dubey is working in the yard lovesick. also of special note were a few shots that were completely out of the narrative. especially while traveling. there was a shot from the back of a bus (i think) that just caught the rain and the distortion so nicely, the distortion and the camera movement worked together so well to convey a mood of confusion and sadness. it almost looked like a bit out of an art film. another thing i liked about the film was the way song worked into it. in most american films i see the musical numbers are entirely forced and out of place in the film. in contrast, the song and dance numbers in monsoon wedding flow completely with the story. you don't even notice it's a musical sequence, it just seems like part of the natural flow of the movie, and it doesn't hurt having such catchy tunes. the last thing i will rave about is the camera work. the many instances of the handheld camera and the in your face style brought a real nice verite style to everything, adding to the realism of everything. also nice was the breaking of the frame, as you mentioned in class. the camera in many instances seemed less like an omnipotent eye, and more like a pov shot of an unmentioned character, you. there are probably problems in monsoon wedding, but i didn't notice any in my one viewing. i came out of the theater in a daze of happiness, a true feel good movie, not dwelling on any mistakes that may have been made, but remembering all the subtle touches, the rare spices added in such small amounts to be hardly noticeable, but without them this stew wouldn't be as unforgettable as it is.", "when i saw it 140503, it was vaguely familiar to me, but my wife recalled it quite well. that's because although i had seen it before, it had no significance, it was just an intimate and authentic look at a loving family with quirky characters having an arranged wedding in india with side dramas. many of the actors were lovely to look at. there were mildly amusing parts and mildly moving parts. there was plenty of surprisingly enjoyable singing and dancing but in an intimate, plausible way, not an over-produced bollywood way.oh, it offered that punjabi have a reputation for ostentation, costumes and such, and bengali have a reputation for pretension (seriousness). this family was punjabi. that's racism, but a helpful handle to begin learning, assuming i heard the names correctly.", "the critic who wrote that monsoon wedding is \"altman goes to bollywood\" had it exactly right.this is a most enjoyable film about a culture that is familiar and very different all at the same time. the mix (sometimes in the same sentence) of the actors' native tongue and english is a delight and the various stories surrounding the wedding are well developed. let's face it, the female characters are exotically stunning too, which helps. this will have a good run in the \"art house\" theatres and will be worth a purchase on dvd, as there's a lot of detail to savour, just like \"gosford park\".", "to begin with, i'm an anthropologist with over 20 years of working overseas-- but nearly all my dealings with indians have been the nri variety. add to that, a traumatic year of studying sanskrit at uc berkeley and it sums up my indian experience. now, having said that, i loved this film! i was thoroughly confused by the kin connections but managed in spite of it.reading through the reviews here, i note nearly everyone but a scant few monolingual english speakers enjoyed the code-switching. well, sports fans, this is what happens in many multi-language settings. i note the nris confirm this is the way they carry on conversations. i found it perfectly delightful.the multilayered storyline with the christian maid and the marriage planner was likewise delightful. too, i was interested in the comments of reviewers who report the accuracy of the depiction of delhi.in sum, i loved the \"slice of life\" portrayal of upper class indians but found the genealogical aspects of the film confusing but never boring.", "a beautiful film. the acting and script are trememdous. the characters have much depth and are wonderfully portrayed. background family relations and relationships are subtly revealed through the clever script and careful and skilled acting and directing. a delicate snapshot--at wedding time--of the life and culture of one indian family .", "hilarious! daring! brave! naseeruddin shah (lalit verma) & lillete dubey (pimmi verma) are brilliant

\"gorgeous!\" \"you will fall in love with it!\" \"tickles your funny bone while igniting passion in the heart!\" \"i didn't want it to end\" you have to see it - to believe it! monsoon wedding is enchanting! a film that has it all!", "as an indian,i've watched many movies which are based on our culture (like this one)directed by indians based in the west. i must say only a few movies like monsoon wedding are truly excellent. from start to finish the movie delivers a platter of culture in the form of dance,drama,comedy and music captivating the viewer with ease. this film deserves all the acclaim and awards it has won. kudos to mira nair and the cast for a fantastic job. put this one in ure \"must-see\" movies category.8/10", "\"monsoon wedding\" was a sensual movie experience. i enjoyed the examination of another culture but i'm sure many cultural references and nuances were missed by me. so much went on and so many people were involved that i wasn't sure who was who. nonetheless the movie was engaging and filled with color, music, dancing and beautiful women. even the closing credits were engaging. i even watched the credits until the very end. actually i watched the interplay of colors beneath the credits. this movie has been compared to \"my big fat greek wedding\" and is similar in that it concerned a wedding but while \"greek wedding\" was an affectionate jab at an ethnic culture \"monsoon wedding\" was a celebration of a culture. it was not as funny as \"greek wedding\" but had some more serious scenes. what it did share was a deep love for the culture portrayed. it is well worth a watch.", "saw this independant film from director mira nair over the weekend and it was more entertaining than i had expected. a tale of a disfunctional family throwing a big wedding in india, the film is at times disorienting due to odd editing and some weird camera touches and slow motion effects.. and i often had a hard time understanding the dialouge due to it being spoken with strong accents.. however, the film works because of excellent casting as almost all of the actors work well and are interesting people... the film was fun. grade: a-", "monsoon wedding- 2001 director: mira nairmonsoon wedding directed by mira nair is a film about an india family marriage. this film is one of the most effective examples of an india family ever put on screen. it displays events ranging form delightful to serious and appalling situations. you see family parties, drama, lots of music and dancing and that one creepy person in the family whom women of the family are afraid of! the great film-making and the use of hand held captures camera scenes is an important setting in the movie.with combinations of warmth and laughter, music and dance, romance and serious problems, director mira nair has made this movie a family entertainment", "we've seen it all before, of course: big wedding, family crises, old scores being settled, secrets being revealed, people falling in love, etc. but when it's done with the freshness, vitality and spirit on show here, somehow it all seems new and exciting again. this is a seductive, beautifully controlled film. watch the scenes involving p.k. and alice, where the film slows down, the camera swirls around, the colours become almost hyper-real and the music intensifies. this is superb film-making. the script is complex and packed with characters and incidents. all of which could become confusing very quickly if it weren't for the superb performances and quiet confidence at the heart of this film. it's hard to imagine how this film could be improved. it strikes me as having just the right balance of comedy, drama, romance and intrigue. each character is entirely believable, every scene is involving and crucial to the film as a whole. nothing is wasted. from the splendid opening credits sequence to the uplifting rain-soaked dance at the end, this is cinema of the highest order. in fact, the only thing wrong with this film, is: it ends.", "monsoon wedding was perhaps one of the most brilliant films i have ever seen. it took me somewhere i'd never been, and by the time two hours were up, i felt at home.a lot of the film's success was in the acting. talented portrayals of deep complex characters who can make you laugh and cry in just minutes. i was amazed how easy it was to keep tabs on no less than 5 separate subplots without getting the characters mixed up or losing interest.another key to monsoon wedding's success was how the camera told as much story as the actors and dialogue. lingering shots on a character who doesn't seem part of the action revealed so much more than dialogue could.and the most amazing thing - this film was made in 30 days!! couldn't believe it. fantastic production values, mind, not like many other indian movies i've seen. and down-to-earth realistic, not like bollywood. yes, there is singing and dancing, but in context, not every five minutes! i don't have anything against bollywood, but i'm glad to see that there is a higher standard of indian film-making out there.", "wow. i knew this was a great movie, but after finally seeing it i'm glad it didn't under-deliver. only meaning to watch a few minutes to get a general feel for the film, it drew me in from start to finish. the characters are well written and just as beautifully played. the plot starts nice and subtle, but does not leave any unanswered questions. most of all, the general feel is very authentic and true. being arab, i can easily relate to the 'family' theme and this is portrayed very well yet without overdoing it. i would like to close by saying this: tears, having become foreign to me, rarely remind me of their existence during certain touching films leading to my development of the phrase 'tear-worthy'. this film is without a doubt tear-worthy.. sniff..", "i just want to add one remark to all of the other good things that have been said about this film (though perhaps it's been said already, since i did not read all 100 of the reviews).the main reason i found this film so uplifting is that is that all of the right decisions were made. in real life, some things that really ought to be forgiven too often aren't; and some things that should never be forgiven too often are. in this film, we see difficult forgiveness given where it is deserved, and a bold and necessary decision not to forgive, forget, or bury one's head in the sand, handled with tremendously admirable grace and courage.of course, there's a great deal more in the film to appreciate than only that. the whole thing is a wonderous slice-of-life montage.people, just by being human, have lots of problems. this film's many themes and subplots never transcend the ordinary; but the total effect of the film evoked more than a few transcendent feelings within me. excellent movie (not outstanding, but excellent).", "the title of the movie is a refection of the continent of it. the indian family is getting ready for a big event: the wedding. the marriage is arranged, which is one of the oldest indian traditions. still let's not forget that it's going on in modern india and the director is mira nair. for me the name of this director is a guarantee that there will be not much simplicity in the movie. after watching only five minutes of this movie i realized that it did not belong in the category of predictable movies. there are quite a few lines which are continuously intertwining together and held my attention till the very end. if i try to go into details i can say that the movie is about a bride who is about to get married but is still in love with a married man, or it's about a father who wants to make a beautiful wedding for his daughter but eventually will find himself torn between the feeling of great debt to one of the members of his family and the fact of revealed child abuse. another direction of the movie could be about the wedding planer who finally finds someone special for himself. looking at all these different scenarios made me unable to pinpoint the main one. also there are many elements of tragedy and comedy going together which makes the movie especially interesting. in addition the movie is beautifully filmed; i liked the action and many colorful elements and details in it. without any doubt i can say that \"monsoon wedding\" is one of my favorites.", "delightful insight into modern day well-to-do indian society (mostly in english but some subtitles). combines a warm description of the stages of a modern hindu wedding but with all the western accessories that make it accessible, understandable and one with which we can identify. the emotional pace of the movie lets us continue as an observer until almost the end, when suddenly the audience is swept up by a well-timed rush of feelgood factors. bollywood meets mobile phones and gets away with it.", "i absolutely loved this film. it is a very beautiful story with numerous love stories intertwined into its fulfilling plot. being a pardesi, the whole essence of this film brought back nostalgic memories of india. i believe that mira nair has struck gold with this great movie.", "i was riveted to my seat throughout the film. the acting is so subtle you don't see any \"acting\" at all; you almost feel as though you are watching a documentary unfolding. the family is large and though the players are a bit difficult to sort out, don't feel bad, even the family members don't know who is who when the wedding festivities get underway. in one memorable exchange, a rather ebullient man is serving as a wild master of ceremonies, speaking quickly and incomprehensibly, and just when you might think you're the only one who doesn't know what's going on, one of the characters says to the groom, \"who is that ##@&*^% anyways?\" and the handsome, charming groom answers politely, \"well, actually, that's my father.\" ahhhh, weddings.but don't go thinking this is some bollywood chick flick. the story is profound, and the wedding is not the main event - merely a forum for more important events to unfold in the lives of people who surround the bride and groom.and if you love indian music, see this. if you have never been exposed to indian music, you may fall in love with it by the time the closing credits roll.i highly recommend this sublime work of movie art.", "i love everything about this movie. the love stories that come together by the end of the movie and the music. wedding scene during credits is so relaxed and nice. its one of my top favorites and would always cherish it. dubey's love story was the most heartwarming and of course the dark history of child abuse was handled so well. the movie does not have one dull moment. love watching it over and over again. monsoon wedding will always be close to my heart. i recommend it to everyone who wants to watch a light, heartwarming and almost-real wedding in india. all the characters were picked so carefully and everyone did a great job. no pretension or over the top acting. very well made and no gimmicks.", "this is a great little gem from mira nair, who directed the somber but thought prevoking salaam bombay. monsoon wedding is leaps and bounds ahead of the grossly overated my big fat greek wedding. there are no indian stereotypes in the film as opoosed to the obese greek wedding. the movie has characters that you would actually find in urban india today.the only reason my big fat greekng is doing so much business and monsoon was only an art house hit is because mainstream north america is afraid to see something that is different. people embraced my big fat greek wedding because it is just white people with a stereotyped greek culture sprkinkled throughout. nothing to be afraid of!in addition the sub plot of the wedding planner and the maid almost manages to steal the entire movie, but the performance of nuseeradhin shah brings the movie back to the main plotline.this is a really good movie with an excellent soundtrack.", "just watched this with my mom on a netflix disc. it's from director/writer mira nair as she chronicles the arranged marriage in india between a young man and woman as well as her affair with a talk show host before hand. there's also a subplot about a young female cousin who reveals a shocking secret and of a wedding planner who longs for his own wedding. there's also some entertaining musical numbers that seem natural in the context of the story and not some bollywood show-stoppers. i did admit to being somewhat confused by who was who in relation to the families but it didn't stop me from being mostly entertained during the whole thing. so on that note, i highly recommend monsoon wedding.", "i was totally charmed by this movie. many people in the western world think that eastern people are \"different\". this movie shows that every family no matter what their ethnic background go through the same angst and have the same wedding jitters as anyone around the world. these were totally likable characters. the slipping in and out of english and indian languages didn't bother me at all. it was good that there were subtitles. this was a totally feel good movie with the right amount of adversity and drama, mixed with comedy and romance. i think it's a great family film.", "this is a masterful film. each of the twenty or so members of the wedding party are fully drawn with almost perfect economy. the bride's younger brother becomes a rich and unique character after just 3 short scenes. the juxtaposition of a touching romance between a pair of hired workers amidst the arranged and lavish upperclass wedding preparations is perfect as the loving heart of the film. a spectacular location, beautifully dressed for a traditional indian wedding is just luminous in declan quinn's gorgeous and mostly hand-held camera work. quinn's grainy, available light panoramas of delhi are a breathtaking contrast and compliment to the lush scenes of the wedding preparation. moving deftly between naturalistic, even sometimes tragic, emotions and light-hearted irony, the film's pace and counterpoints struck me as precisely on the mark. this is a really wonderful film full of a love of life, humanity and india. simply irresistible.", "i really liked the story of dubey but everything else in movie was not all that good. but i'm not a fan of romantic movies anyway. it would be nice if they did a more exhaustive part on that. otherwise, good music and beautiful cinematography.", "this is a terrific movie definitely worth seeing. the story is of life in the upper class in northern india, although it doesn't souly focus on them. it begins 4 days before a wealthy man's daughter(aditi) is wed, an arranged marriage. however, she is in love still with her ex-boyfriend, leading to trouble. as i mentioned, the movie doesn't souly focus on this subject matter. in fact, less than 1/8th of the movie focuses on that plot line. there is also the bride's cousin, ria, who learns her younger sister, aliya, is being sexually abused by the same man who sexually abused her at the same age. there is aditi's younger brother, who shocks the family by his interests in life, including dancing, singing, and cooking. this leads to trouble just a few days before the wedding. and much more! all this mess mounts up, but will it destroy the wedding?i particularly liked the acting a lot in this movie. it all seems so real, it takes you on the emotional ride of life. i rarely have emotional reactions at movies, but here, at points, i would be laughing and crying at the same time, because so much was going on. the only complaint i had about the movie was that when the characters spoke english, their indian accents were heavy and hard to understand, and since they were speaking english, there wasn't any subtitles then. however, the plot wasn't too hard to catch on to, and therefore, i give it 9/10 stars! go see it...now!!!", "like all of mira nair's films set in india, much of what goes on will be baffling to non-indian viewers; you just have to \"go with it\" and be rewarded. i **strongly** recommend to anyone with access to the dvd to watch it again with her \"director's commentary\" audio-track turned on! she explains her purpose, who the actors are, how the costumes and sets were designed, what she was trying to accomplish in various scenes; it opens up the film and makes it much more accessible. this is true of all of her films, particularly the shimmering and complex \"kama sutra\".casting note: the stunningly handsome young man who appears out of the rain at the very end of the film is jas arora, a popular male-model.", "it is either you love it or laugh it.in it's simplicity line, there are many complexity stated in this movie. the beauty lies in its cultural background and the characters built upon one single event: the wedding. but you got to see many love and faces of family life here. love of a father, daughter, mother, sister, aunt, even in laws.in it's simplicity, you simply fall in love with the family and ended up joins the wedding yourself.the simple flaw of this movie however is off course due to its many characters, we're left with the red line of it. though it should've been more beautiful to see and learn more with the individual characters, though it might need more than additional 200 mins to cover all that.but it was forgiven. we were invited to a wedding, and we see this lovable family interacts and intacts. and that's the universal meaning of a wedding. to celebrate love and love to celebrate.a perfect sunday-family movie.", "by the end of the of screening of this movie, one feels like they were in a different world. a world full of flawed people, a world full of stressful situations and a world with tons of black humor. if one expects monsoon wedding to be a loud slapstick comedy, please change your expectations. expect nearly 2 hours of subtle comedy and expect to experience a wedding like no other.lalit verma is a higher class delhi man arranging his daughter's wedding. cash flow is a little tight, but that's just one of the many problems he's going to have to face. aditti has a married ex who she is still seeing just when her father is arranging her marriage to hemmat. dubey is an event planner and he's in love.if i have to give a vague analysis, i'd say monsoon wedding is not about a wedding at all. it's a about unresolved situations coming up in a wedding. whether it is a stressed father, a confused daughter forcing herself into a marriage, a woman having to see her disturbing childhood again but thru the eyes of another or even a crazy event planner's realization to settle down.now if you have not seen the movie, you probably think, \"what does this have to do anything with a festive indian wedding?\" well, nothing. all these subplots unfold during this festive wedding.that is the genius of mira nair's monsoon wedding. there is a lot of depth in the characters. every character has flaws to overcome by the end of the movie. best of all, we as the viewers are glued to the screen to know how things will end.there are some notable scenes in the film. the initial reels are exciting because several subplots are being introduced. of course the scene with aditti's realization that she is doing wrong is significant. not to forget her confession to her fiancé is gripping.the scenes with vijay raaz put a smile on your face. naseer's scene when he's looking at his children and talking to his wife is excellent. of course, the most dramatic scene would be the one near the climax when riya confesses her childhood.i do feel the film slows down in the middle and even a bit in the second half. that is the major flaw i have. i do want to add, the film could have been trimmed down a bit. slightly.the music is good with a good choice of handpicked songs to play in the background. none of these songs are original though. good songs nonetheless.the writing is crisp and the characters are strongly written. editing is a small issue here. screenplay is engaging. lines in the movie are fantastic. kudos! mira nair's direction is good. it's different and definitely in a good way. the whole colorization and art goes well with the tone of the movie.just like in the movie, lalit verma keeps the family in check and is holds it together. it is naseerudhin shah's performance that holds this movie together. he is an incredible actor and there is no doubt. if you're a fan like myself, do not miss this act. he's just flawless. note the scenes when he goes tense and yells, note his dramatic scenes. note in the climax when he has to make a decision. note his punjabi. just astounding.another performance that stands out is vijay raaz. he's got a strange intensity in him. his comedy is great and there is no doubt. however, he shows his dramatic side here. a great act.shehfali shah is a talent no given enough credit. she's first rate. we need to see her more. lillete dubey supports well. vasundhra das does a good job. pravin dabas is effective. kulbhushan karbanda is lovable. rajat kapoor does well. others support well.overall - a black comedy with a good share of drama. if you want something different and good, go for it.", "hands down this is my favorite movie. (with my name is kahn in second place). my mom got this movie for me. i saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. the movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. but the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the \"real world\" before the wedding they realize that the wedding host could of been them and they respect that. in my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were about to wed and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. in the end the film tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (such as the last scene of the movie). this is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. i tip my hat to the indian filmmakers.", "i've just read all the comments made to date about this movie and was relieved to see that about 90% of those who either are native of india or familiar with it, were very pleased by the way the movie depicted delhi and the family. to me, it had seemed to have the flavor of authenticity -- as much as one can expect to get from a movie -- so it's nice to have that confirmed by the majority.aside from the interesting differences between cultures, what struck me were the similarities among families, their relationships, their problems, etc. and, like people in real life, the central characters were presented as more than one-dimensional -- they had flaws, some minor and some major, with which they cope and force others to cope, and somehow -- in this case -- were able to achieve kind of a triumph. the relation between the roles of men and women remind me in some ways of that which existed in the u.s.a. in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. the film had so many characters that i wish i'd had a genogram (a family map) or at least a program (\"you can't tell the players without a program\") to keep all the relatives straight. no matter; for those of us who liked it a lot, this is a movie well worth seeing several times to catch all the parts that we missed the first time. in that way, it reminds me of a piece of complex serious music -- one does not expect (and should not demand) to get everything at a first hearing from something with any weight. i think that some of those comments that this is a \"cookie cutter\" movie, a robert altman version of \"father of the bride\" but in india, are both fair and unfair. a wedding is a traditional major liturgical event in almost all cultures. two people from different families come together and form a new family. call it cookie cutter and altman-esque if you wish, but isn't it at the time of these most significant of human events -- birth, death, marriage -- that families come together and those same things transpire in every culture? a babe is born? the dead are put to rest? a new family is formed? and how many weddings have _you_ ever attended that were not altman-esque in their cast of characters? if a scholar of different cultures were to compare cultures, certainly we'd want to know the role of family, of the autonomy and power of men vs. women, fidelity, class, and how marriage, death, birth, and the raising of the young are handled -- wouldn't we? this movie covers almost all that ground.if your favorite movies have lots of special effects, chases, fights, etc., don't see it, you won't like it. if you don't like \"slice of life\" movies, don't see it, you won't like it. but if you enjoyed \"smoke signals,\" \"gosford park,\" \"the long road (the chinese movie, or was it the \"long road home\"?), chances are you'll _really_ like this one. i gave it a \"9\" and it could as well have been \"10.\""]}

fairly well. the film concerns itself with blind hero worship, as a mesmerized nation mourns the sudden accidental death of a national icon. a much respected reporter (spencer tracy), just back from europe where he's witnessed the early horrors of world war ii prior to u.s. entry into the conflict, has arrived just after the great man's tragic auto accident. he decides to write the hero's biography, so to immortalize his memory. while he manages to distance himself from the jostling pool of reporters, his biggest challenge is in seeing the great man's reclusive widow (katharine hepburn). in short, once the contact is made and the research process undertaken, we see the deceased as through a prism of characters: the eerily effective secretary (richard whorf); the down-home philosopher-cab driver (percy kilbride); the laconic and somewhat cynical doctor (frank craven, who observes of the mass hysteria: \"some of us held out;\" a pouting cousin (forrest tucker), and an embittered caretaker (howard da silva) who had been the hero's captain in world war i. now, restricted physically by wounds he suffered, he has served the man he once commanded. he seems resentful of the man who saved his life in combat. the effect of unbridled hero worship on an impressioable young mind is captured in the caretaker's son (darryl hickman), convinced he is responsible for the death of his idol. his role becomes tedious, but is critical to the underlying psychology of the film.like the peeling of an onion, the film reveals layer after layer of the people in the life of a giant, his relations with them, and the passions stirred by his presence ... and his causes. we see that it is wise to temper emotion with information in selecting our icons. while tracy and hepburn are quite good in their roles, it is the supporting cast which drives the film. whorf, da silva and craven are outstanding in key roles. the bronislau kaper score and excellent black and white cinematography preserve the quality of the drama and help it through its dated moments.", "keeper of the flame is the answer to the trivia question, what film contained the only screen death for either katherine hepburn or spencer tracy in their joint projects.this was their second teaming and after the comedy of woman of the year, they tried a change of pace with a melodrama. pearl harbor was still fresh in everyone's minds and so was the discredited isolationist movement.it's chief spokesperson was charles lindbergh on whom the character of hepburn's husband robert forrest was based. lindbergh's too close association with germany tarred him for the rest of his life. here robert forrest is killed right at the beginning of the film as he drives over a bridge that's ready to collapse. the death of forrest brings out the grief of a nation and reporters flock to his manderley like estate.one of those reporters is spencer tracy who by some chicanery gains entrance to the place and meets the widow forrest and her husband's chief aide richard whorf. the place reeks of sinister and tracy's curiosity is aroused. he also meets margaret wycherly who is hepburn's mother-in-law. she's one batty old dame. a far cry from gary cooper's mother a year before who wycherly played in sergeant york.hepburn seeks to preserve her late husband's reputation at the risk of her own in sending tracy out on a red herring. he discovers the truth and how he does it and the result therein is the crux of the film.tracy and hepburn are at their professional best working for the first time with george cukor who later guided them through adam's rib and pat and mike. richard whorf is very good as the malevolent aide.after over 60 years the film still packs a powerful dramatic punch.", "keeper of the flame was made during the early days of world war ii. it revolves around the life, beliefs, and death of one man but is a lesson for one nation, or one world, interested in the freedoms we were fighting for and the evils we were fighting against in 1942.spencer tracy portrays a reporter-to-author who is to write the biography of a man recently deceased. the deceased was a very successful businessman who had launched a campaign for public office but was killed --- by accident, intention, or a combination of the two --- before he could claim his victory. and, it would have been a victory; the public was charmed by the man they believed embodied the american ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness... or success. hepburn plays the widow of this 'man of the people', and, as such, someone who must be interviewed by tracy. the more questions tracy asks of those near and dear to his subject, the fewer answers he finds. our reporter eventually comes to believe there is one american ideal with which his deceased subject did not agree: the equality of all men, regardless of race or religion. ever the typical skeptical journalist, tracy won't begin to write for publication until he can fully answer a few interesting questions: who had this man really been? had he been the steadfast and lone american patriot all believed him to be ... or had he been a member of an organization whose primary goal was to raise one ethnic, religious, and racial group above the rest? had he really been killed in an 'accident'? and, if not, had he been killed by those who agreed or disagreed with his political motives? also of interest to our journalist: how well had hepburn's character known her husband? does she agree with his political agenda? how much does she really know about the 'accident' that killed him. and, most importantly, how far would she... or anyone else... go to make sure her husband was remembered as an honest american?this movie is a mystery / political thriller / morality play / who-done-it. it is also a lesson to 'be careful what you wish for' and highly recommended.", "in the early days of the 1940's, america was being inexorably drawn into world war two. during that time, there was a great national isolationist movement which sought to keep america out of the global conflict. the strongest and perhaps the most influential figures which arose were america's heroes. among them was famed aviator, charles lindbergh. having visited germany prior to the invasion of poland, was convinced america could not win a war against germany. this movie called \" keeper of the flame \" represents the views of the late robert forest, a rich industrialist, popular and civic leader who although groomed himself as a true american patriot, was in fact a 'sleeper' fascist. because he believed forest was an american hero, steve o'malley (spencer tracy) a famous war correspondent, returns home. his mission is to write the biography of forest. instead, as he begins writing the story, he discovers that forest's wife christine (katharine hepburn) and her family is hiding a family secret which everyone wants to keep buried with the deceased. with richard whorf, margaret wycherly and forrest tucker in supporting roles, this mysterious film quickly becomes a spy vs spy drama. one which tracy and hepburn play to the hilt. due to her association with her husband, i could not help but see bogart in this movie. nevertheless, this is a dark film which easily explains the title. recommended to anyone wanting to recall why america eventually went to war. ****", "one of the rare tracy - hepburn vehicles which plays as a drama, rather than their more usual light comedy fare and even though it was directed by their pet director george cukor, none of them can rise above the rather stolid material they get to purvey here.made not long after america's entry into the second world war, it has a credible message to sell in putting out a warning to any lingering isolationist waverers, especially if egged on by a national hero, recalling the america first movement of the time led by transatlantic pilot charles lindbergh as well as pointing up the importance of a free press, especially in times of war.it's just that the story itself moves so slowly as tracy's truth-seeking ethical, high-brow reporter steve o'malley, alone in these traits, it seems, of all the media circus which descends on the household of the widow of national hero robert forrest, there to report on his death after his car crashes to the bottom of a ravine where the bridge has failed in a storm. o'malley, an admirer himself of forrest, doesn't want to write about the great man's dramatic death however, but instead his life and example. however he gets inveigled into murky waters as he gets closer to the truth by tracking down his grieving wife, played by hepburn, naturally, who has otherwise made herself incommunicado to the encroaching press.tracy seems disinterested in his part, rarely displaying the conviction his role demands while hepburn on the other hand seems to over-compensate by trying too hard at times as she occasionally gazes away from the camera and recites her lines in full \"calla-lilies' mode. there's a suggestion of romance between the two but too little too late and you're left thinking that maybe their vaunted screen chemistry only comes to life in comedies.they're not helped by weak sub-plotting and a selection of supporting characters which vary from the insipid to the overdone, the former category including the father and son of the deceased man's gamekeeper, the latter, his faraway, in more ways than one, mother, his conniving male p.a. and worst of all a masticating, drawling cab-driver who does all he can to build up his part.by the time we reach the conclusion, the heightened drama of which itself is at odds with the pedestrian pace of what precedes it, you sense the actors are glad to reach the end too.i guess every day has its dog and for spencer, katherine and george, each so good in so many other things, this is definitely one of those.", "i'm sure anyone seeing this film will wonder just what is happening. this great cast made a very serious movie and were lines they could deliver powerfully dramatically and evenly to convey a whole range of emotions.the plot is easily summarized. a reporter, o'malley (spencer tracy) wants to write -- what? he's not certain -- a piece on an icon who people revere in the same way they might (say) washington or lincoln, the first part of the film is documents how to get to see the icon's wife. she's reclusive and her servants are dedicated to preserving her sanctity. what's behind this isolation? that in itself is a bothersome question for o'malley. something is not ringing right. she was the wife of a popular public figure. why wouldn't she cooperate? as he digs, he finds he cannot write the story, at first because he does not know enough, and then because he knows too much of the wrong thing and finally because he suspects he does not know what is hidden from him and it is critical.and as he untwists the gordian knot that is presented to him, he finds there is duplicity and mendacity on every level. but nothing is as simple as it seems. instead of writing about the icon, he picks the wife.but that is not the depth of the film. the depth is revealed as we learn about the hepburn character and tracy's response. he moves from someone who can ignore genuine interest in him by a woman, (audrey christie), and seek his goal. what develops is first a genuine friendship followed by an admiration that transcends almost any other kind of relationship.that is a very complicated situation to convey in the simple straight forward acting method of tracy's (but he always manages to do what is required of him), and mysterious sophisticated quality that hepburn always wears like some garment only given once by the gods who give such gifts.this is not an easy exercise. don't get caught in the datedness. watch how the actors, directors and writers put together something that is admirable in its mixture of simplicity and complexity -- what others have called pealing the onionskin off the inion.", "even though the story about fascism on the home front is strongly connected to its time period during world war ii, the film's deeper warning remains true -- people who play hero to the masses may not be what they appear.great performances from the great team, tracy and hepburn. the atmosphere of mystery and gradual revelation of the amazing truth makes the film absorbing and tense. though the film is not well known, this is definitely a classic.", "katharine hepburn is \"keeper of the flame\" in this 1942 film starring spencer tracy, and directed by george cukor. a reporter, just back from being in europe, wants to write about a tremendous hero/statesman, robert forest, who has just died in an accident. but his reporter instincts pick up something rotten as he attempts to speak with the widow (hepburn) and learns things about forest and the family. he begins to suspect that the great man's death might not have been so accidental.very dark and intriguing movie, well done, with a crackerjack cast that includes margaret wycherly, forrest tucker, stephen mcnally, darryl hickman, howard da silva, and percy kilbride. the script, by donald ogden stewart, is perhaps inspired by charles lindbergh's story. done today (as if anything could be kept from the press) it might be jfk.my only problem with this film is the prescribed code ending. well worth watching - something quite different for tracy and hepburn, who usually performed lighter fare when together.", "george cukor's keeper of the flame was completely unknown to me, and i was very pleased by the surprise. early on in the film it occurred to me that it was a ww2 propaganda film inspired by the real-life stories of lindbergh and butler, and so i had a strong sense of how the plot was likely to unfold. but instead of diminishing my interest, that made me even more attentive. tracy and hepburn are great, the cinematography sets up a somber and mysterious mood, and there are even a few innovative, \"artistic\" camera shots. the film's second half is not as good as the first, probably because we are let in on the \"secrets\" of the story a bit too soon.", "one of my favorite spencer tracy movies, keeper of the flame is probably the most serious of all the films teaming tracy with katherine hepburn, perhaps the only one that might fit the \"noir\" class. mystery surrounds the death of national hero robert forrest. reporter steve o'malley (tracy) wants to do a biography of the late statesman, but the closer he tries to get to the family on their huge estate (sort of a gothic version of the kennedy compound), the more it seems forrest's widow (hepburn) and secretary are trying to hide something. tracy begins to suspect their foul involvement in the hero's supposed accidental death. in addition to the great tracy and hepburn and an intriguing story, there are fine performances from the supporting cast which includes a young forrest tucker (spencer, tracy, and kong), darryl hickman (fighting father dunn), howard da silva (1776), percy kilbride (pa kettle), and others.", "in aiming at political seriousness this tracy/hepburn vehicle proved to be something of a misfire for all concerned. the story is that old chestnut about the hero who had feet of clay or in this case an american icon killed in an automobile accident who is revealed to be a fascist. it's got one of the few really bad katharine hepburn performances, (admittedly she is saddled with some terrible material), and tracy isn't much better as the journalist who sets out to write the man's life story, (he get glummer as the picture progresses as if it's just dawned on him what he's let himself in for). cukor directed and donald ogden stewart did the screenplay but this is no \"philadelphia story\" but a rather turgid drama masquerading as a thriller but one minus the thrills. if you want to be preached at, go to church where even the dullest sermon would be a lot more fun than this.", "this film is early in the tracy-hepburn canon, and not widely regarded as one of their best efforts. the thing is, coming out so shortly after their landmark woman of the year, it isn't properly a tracy-hepburn vehicle so much as a george cukor-donald ogden stewart movie in which they happen to appear.it is the story of a newspaperman (tracy) out to investigate the circumstances behind the death of a much beloved american hero, meets and falls in love with the man's widow (hepburn)who, along with everyone else whoever knew the man, seems to be harboring some dark secrets as to the true nature of his character. the film owes some obvious debts to citizen kane in being the inside scoop on a recently deceased man presumed to be great but who was in actuality something else altogether. in its somber mood, forbidding mansion, enigmatic and generally paranoid aspect, keeper of the flame suggests kane in many regards, but is, to be fair, its own film.tracy and hepburn play their roles exceedingly well. the supporting cast is well-chosen, and percy kilbride does a nice turn as a cab-driver; while margaret wycherly is scarifying as the dead man's mad mother; and a young, aryan-looking-as-all-getout forrest tucker scoots about on a motorcycle like he'd join hitler's minions at the drop of a hat. richard whorf in what at the time must have seemed a 'daring' performance, plays a fussy secretary to the dead hero in a manner which suggests a combination of repressed mania and strong homosexual tendencies. his character is wholly unbelievable but awfully fun to watch.the movie has a dark, gothic cast to it, and was obviously filmed on a studio back-lot, but the result is not so much unreality as the suggestion of a fairy tale or a fable strangely consistent with the film's intent, and hence satisfying, making its woods and country roads look at times like a weird and twisted perversion of a norman rockwell painting.", "the pitfalls of blind hero worship are examined at length in keeper of the flame with spencer tracy as an intrepid reporter trying to find out what dark secrets are behind all the repressed household members who refuse to divulge much information about a dead patriot. most secretive of all is katharine hepburn as the man's widow who, it turns out, is the real \"keeper of the flame\" in that she cannot divulge what it is that's behind the death of her husband who was so beloved by the public.it's a heavy-handed treatment that george cukor gives this story, interesting but very flawed in that it cloaks everything in too much ambiguity until the final moments. by that time, viewers will be wondering when this long-winded scenario will end.it's almost an early film noir in its presentation--very low-key lighting full of shadows as dark as the mystery behind the man's existence. was he trying to ruin america with his fascism? was he clearly a man who deserved death as a punishment for his sins? very unusual for an mgm film of this period to soak up so much noir atmosphere and, more than that, to serve as a vehicle for the talents of hepburn and tracy. some of it works, but much of it is tedious in the telling.a good cast gives it what it deserves, no more, no less, including forrest tucker, margaret wycherly and darryl hickman (in another one of his tiresome childhood roles). certainly not for everyone's taste.george cukor's fussy attention to detail holds the film back from being a taut exercise in suspense.", "keeper of the flame (1942)*** (out of 4) deeply involving drama has an american hero getting killed in a car accident and while the country mourns his death a reporter (spencer tracy) goes to his home to try and tell his life story. when the reporter finally meets the widow (katharine hepburn) he starts to realize that there's a mysterious truth behind the man's legend that might go against everything he stood for. i'm not sure why this film doesn't get more credit when people discuss the various films with tracy and hepburn but i found the movie to be very involving and contain quite a bit of suspense. the film was clearly influenced by citizen kane and this is easy to see in the film's look and atmosphere. the movie is incredibly dark and i really can't recall one scene that takes place with any light. the cinematography really captures the moody settings and the visual style is certainly very impressive. tracy is his usual self in that he gives another wonderful and intense performance. tracy is one of my favorite actors because you can read so much into just by watching his face and here the intensity in his face is great to watch. hepburn is also wonderful in her role and when she finally reveals all the secrets towards the end, it's among the best i've seen her in any movie. i think the film has some flaws including the whole mystery aspect that takes too long to reveal. i think the film would have been better had some hints been dropped throughout the film but instead they are all held for the end. even with that flaw, this is still a highly entertaining film that deserves more credit than it gets.", "this film is a rarity that, according to my information, was only shown once (on november 15, 1987) on west german television. there may be reasons for this,

full of wistful enthusiasm for the deceased, the journalist, with the help of the politician's widow (katharine hepburn), uncovers an unbelievable secret...nothing more may be revealed, but the secret is powerful and still points forward to our time. for director george cukor and the then hollywood major mgm, the film was a box office disaster. this story was simply too much for american audiences. it's a shame that this film has been forgotten since the 1980s. but maybe he'll show up again at some point. another german title is the better translated hüter der flamme.", "keeper of the flame (metro-goldwyn-mayer, 1942), directed by george cukor, teams spencer tracy and katharine hepburn for the second time. following their initial success in the comedy woman of the year (1942), one would expect their second union to be of a similar nature with laughs with doses of drama and romance. instead, keeper of the flame is more of a dark, moody and psychological melodrama offering none of the ingredients of tracy and hepburn the public loved so well as with future amusements as adam's rib (1949), pat and mike (1952) and desk set (1957). based on the novel by i. a. r. wylie, the material presented has more of a feel of director alfred hitchcock than george cukor, along with its sociological message combined with doses of mystery.the story begins during a rainy thunderstorm evening where a car is seen driving off a collapsed bridge, followed by spread headlines reading \"robert forrest killed,\" and \"death of a hero.\" steven o'malley (spencer tracy) is introduced as a news correspondent having just returned from europe on his next assignment. he is accompanied by reporter friends, freddie ridges (horace mcnally) and jane harding (audrey christie) outside the forrest gates awaiting for an interview with the widow. during the funeral procession, o'malley comforts a crying boy, jed (darryl hickman), son of the jason rickards (howard da silva), the gatekeeper, claiming to be responsible for forrest's death. overheard of wanting to write the life story of robert forrest, o'malley is approached by geoffrey midford (forrest tucker), cousin of the widow, who threatens him against it. still hoping for an interview, it is jed who steers o'malley down the right path to the home of christine forrest. while inside, o'malley finds christine forrest (katharine hepburn, appearing 25 minutes into the start of the story) lighting a candle in her husband's memory. startled at first by his presence, christine later agrees to provide enough information for a tribute to the national hero husband, along with the assistance of clive kerndon (richard whorf), her husband's private secretary. during the course of the story, o'malley stumbles upon forrest's mother (margaret wycherly), an insane invalid, along with enough material of unforeseen circumstances that places both steven and christine in danger for their lives. co-starring frank craven (doctor fielding); donald meek (mr. arbuthot); and blanche yurka (anna taylor). audrey christie, in her movie debut, appears as a glenda farrell-type newspaper woman with some love interest to o'malley. percy kilbride as orion, a taxi driver, is the only actor here to offer some lighter moments in the story.for a tracy and hepburn movie, keeper of the flame is the only one in which they share no love scenes. as much as hepburn does well in her difficult yet offbeat assignment, one would wonder if the movie might have succeeded to better advantage had greta garbo played the grief-stricken widow instead. even if this might not have succeeded with garbo having no chemistry with tracy, possibly casting her in this stylish film noir mystery might have broadened garbo's range against type in heavy dramatics, or put an end to her career. much of the players here come off looking depressed, making the movie feel more like a funeral than a suspense mystery. the plot is often slow and talky until it picks up with a hepburn's well performed nine minute monologue to tracy followed by a suspenseful climax of truth and danger.formerly distributed on video cassette and later presented on dvd, keeper of the flame had played on numerous cable channels, notably on turner classic movies. while the movie might prove disappointing for first time viewers, keeper of the flame is of sole interest in the teaming of tracy and hepburn in something completely different in both style and visual aspects. (**1/2)", "first half is good as spencer tracy essentially gives us a precursor to \"bad day at black rock\", namely a lone honest man arrives in a small town and starts asking a lot of questions, in this case about a recently deceased lindbergh type hero who obviously is not quite what he seems (ed). reinforcing this uneasy mood is william daniels' wonderful noirish cinematography which renders the former hero's place of residence kind of a combination xanadu and bates motel.second half, however, takes a sharp wrong turn as director george cukor and his scenarist donald o stewart (bill gorton to you \"sun also rises\" fans) proceed to tell the less compelling story. instead of focusing on forrest and why he went from patriot to fascist we are offered instead a romance between spence and kate and a rather dull, melodramatic romance at that, with no humor, which is, of course, the kiss of death to this particular couple. and instead of a properly chilling denouement in which the threat of \"heroes\" like forrest is fully brought out (as it has been during this month's 1/6 hearings in congress) we get in its place reassuring nostrums from spence about the wisdom of the average american (you know, like they're exhibiting now in texas and florida ) and a rather silly shoot out involving forrest's smarmy secretary, a most unsatisfying chief villain.bottom line: this could be the worst tracy/hepburn pairing ever, although it's been awhile since i've seen \"sea of grass\". c plus.", "american hero robert forrest dies driving off a bridge. the nation mourns with the support of the mass media. as a leading member of the forward america association, he traveled europe meeting many fascist dignitaries and inspiring the youth of the nation. skeptical journalist stephen o'malley (spencer tracy) is researching to write a biography of the man. after the funeral procession, most of the media leaves with suspicious reporters jane harding and freddie ridges remaining behind. stephen interviews forrest's reclusive widow christine (katharine hepburn) and discovers robert's hidden mother. he befriends a young boy named jeb who blames himself for not warning mr. forrest of the failed bridge.this anti-fascist film comes out a year after pearl harbor. if the studio had any guts, filming would have started before the attack. instead, it's well after the attack when the studio finally allows the project to go forward. still it was met with political complaints of its direct comparison to real world connections. as a film, it plods along. other than it directly connects to fascism in pre-war america, there is nothing of note. it's not dramatic. the mystery ends up not much of a mystery. stephen doesn't even face any real danger until the last ten minutes. it all wraps up in a fascist takeover reveal that has the sound of reality in today's world and a rushed action sequence. this tackles a dark daring subject matter but it's not as good in terms of story telling.", "this film is chloroform in celluloid and features the worst performances ever by tracy and hepburn. it is also cukor's worst film. several of the supporting players especially audrey christie are solid but darryl hickman as the child is dreadful. he isn't helped by donald ogden stewart's leaden dialogue. even tracy stutters and sputters in a vain attempt to bring stewart's agit-prop slop to life. stewart was a patrician communist who probably got his mission to smear the great patriot charles lindbergh and the noble isolationist movement straight from moscow. while stewart and his dupe colleagues made this film in hollywood comfort, charles lindbergh was actively fighting fascism by training american pilots and developing aircraft. he volunteered for active fighter pilot service but fdr would not let him serve knowing that lindbergh would have been an ace. however, friends helped lindbergh fly combat missions against japan. now, how many of those did stewart, cukor and tracy fly?

'keeper of the flame' as some have noted is a very different tracy-hepburn film, this is not the light sophisticated romantic/screwball comedies that most of their other collaborations were. instead it has touches of gothic, mystery and politics (et. al) with a quite dark edge, and it makes for their darkest, most serious and most ambitious film. it is not as well known as some of their others and is not considered one of their best. can understand why, being someone who does consider it a lesser film of theirs (their weakest perhaps) and the weakest film they did with cukor, the best being my personal favourite of their films 'adam's rib'.it doesn't completely work. the final third gets very melodramatic, to a slightly too heavy-going degree, and the ending with the final monologue did veer on the patronising and long-winded.some of the pace could have been tightened, some of it is on the ponderous side, and the central relationship could have done with more spark. tracy and hepburn do work well together certainly, it just doesn't sparkle as much or is fully utilised as much as their other films and it doesn't have the excuse of it still settling or yet to find its feet when it gelled so well in 'woman of the year'.with saying all of this, it sounds like 'keeper of the flame' was a bad film. to some it is, but to me it isn't. there is a lot to like and on the most part it's quite decent if uneven. none of the faults the film has are with hepburn and tracy, in fact they are the two main reasons to see it. tracy brings intensity and subtlety to his role while once again the ever radiant hepburn attacks the showier role with abandon (all the while being more subdued than she is in some of her other films, not a knock against her in any way but merely a brief comparison). with the sole exception of grating darryl hickman, the supporting cast are also good, margaret wycherly and richard whorf faring most memorably.cukor generally directs with control and tautness and the whole of 'keeper of the flame' looks great, from the ravishingly atmospheric photography to the effectively claustrophobic production design. bonislau kaper's ominous and stirring score is another big strength, and although the script is imperfect (with the same issues of some of the pace) it does provoke thought. much of the story, with a scintillating opening scene setting so much promise, is suspenseful and sometimes moving, the themes also remarkably relevant now regardless of how people feel about the execution. the characters are also interesting with a good deal of meat to them.on the whole, uneven but decent. 6/10 bethany cox", "this film bears no resemblance to the other spencer tracy - katherine hepburn films. it is a very serious drama, with no hint of comedy.and, while it sometimes veers into melodrama, it is a very important film that needs to be seen. it deals with the dangers of third columnists, those who, impatient with democracy, would bring fascism to this country. meet john doe hints at this as well, but not as powerfully as this movie.yes, it's melodramatic at times. but it tells, very well, a very important tale, one that we dare never forget.watch this movie, if you get a chance. and remember its message, which, alas, is for all times. those with power, especially those who have acquired power through wealth, sometimes lose patience with democracy and want to by-pass it to get what they want. it is the function of a free press to expose them, and to save us from them.---------------------------------i just watched this movie again - i've seen it several times since i wrote the above review nine years ago, well before a certain real estate tycoon came to power. but that tycoon is not what i want to talk about here.reading over some of the other comments that have accrued since then, i see that for some the highly dramatic, indeed sometimes melodramatic style of the movie has been a problem. it's true: both in the way some of the actors - hepburn, wycherly - deliver their lines and in the way cukor directed this film and had it lit, the movie comes off as a sort of gothic horror story, like frankenstein, about a mad man who wants supreme powers. i can see that that style may be off-putting to young people not accustomed to it.it is also highly theatrical, even through it is adapted from a novel and not a play. in particular the final scene in the cabin between hepburn and tracy seems very much like a speech in a stage play. hepburn's perfect enunciation contrasts with tracy's equally clear but more natural speech. it's almost - almost - like a serious version of *midsummer madness*, the play that the movie *auntie mame* makes fun of.still, it would be a shame if the theatrical style of the movie put off modern viewers, since the message of this movie - and it very definitely has one - is so very important.and that message is well told. it would have been easier, but much less effective, to present the newspaper reporter, tracy, as suspicious of the great man, robert forrest, from the beginning. instead, we get to watch him discover that his idol had feet of clay, even though that is not the truth he wants to find. tracy does a great job of presenting that in the cabin scene, even while hepburn is enunciating her long speech as if she were on stage. (compare this scene with the end of *amadeus*, where we watch the priest's ideals fall apart as his listens to salieri recount the life behind his music and mozart's.)so i repeat my \"must watch\" recommendation from nine years ago. even if the melodramatic style is not to your liking, it's worth paying attention to what this film has to say.", "i'm not fond of spencer tracy or kate hepburn when they're on their own, but i really, really like them together. each seems to make the other palatable, even if they're just doing their usual (tracy plays tracy...and hepburn plays hepburn). however, they did have their share of stinkers, and this is probably the biggest of them all. it's only notable for the fact that this is the only tracy-hepburn film where one of them dies.the plot is that national hero robert forrest was killed in a car accident, but journalist steve o'malley (tracy) wants the truth. he approaches forrest's widow christine (hepburn), but she and some of her lackeys are hiding things about robert and who he really was, as well as what he really stood for. the political undertones in this film aren't really undertones, they're much too strong to be comfortably there, but it's not the fact that the film is saturated in political undertones that makes it a dud. it's the fact that nothing happens.katharine hepburn is acting so hard that you don't feel any sympathy for her character. get a load of that first dress she wears- it's like a straitjacket! spencer tracy isn't given much to do other than scowl and mug for the camera, and wear his hat at a jaunty angle. the chemistry that they had so strongly is woman of the year is pretty much non-existent here- there could have been a romance subplot, but because everyone is too busy acting, it just wouldn't have been believable. even though it's tracy and hepburn. yikes.none of the other actors are anything special, they're merely stock characters. audrey christie is all wrong in a role that needed an eve arden or a rosalind russell. stephen mcnally is your average evil dude with a mustache. that annoying child actor is the stock crying little boy who helps the protagonist. and margaret wycherty is your stock batty old mother of the deceased man. the m-g-m sets are too slick, too similar to other m-g-m sets, and it's bothersome. george cukor's directing style is all wrong for a propaganda film that's just dying to be directed by frank capra. there are even capra-esque touches, like the newsreel montages at the beginning and the end.there's not much to recommend here, unless you like wartime preachy propaganda films with katharine hepburn doing too much acting, like she usually does, and spencer tracy mugging too much, like he usually does. this film tries its damndest to be sort of like his girl friday meets citizen kane and fails dramatically.i only watched it because i'm trying to watch all the tracy-hepburn films (six down and three- desk set, state of the union and the sea of grass- to go).", "\"keeper of the flame\"(1942)was the second film starring the team of spencer tracy and katharine hepburn. their first was the delightful george stevens comedy,\"woman of the year\",which was a smash hit at the box office. however,many critics consider their second film to be a not bad, but lesser teaming. this is mainly because the characters tracy and hepburn play lack the romantic chemistry that was evident in their other films. also,because of the dark theme of the plot,there is no room for any comical moments. with that said, \"keeper of the flame\" is a brilliant mystery-drama with a timely theme:the dangers of false hero-worship. steven o'malley(spencer tracy)is a reporter wanting to write a story on the life of robert forrest,a beloved american hero, who has suddenly been killed in a tragic car accident. o'malley has found it difficult to get an interview with the devastated widow,christine forrest(katharine hepburn). while waiting for the interview, he encounters peculiar people well-acquainted with the deceased. he meets forrest's brother-in-law(forrest tucker),an embittered man,who seems to despise forrest, a young boy(daryll hickman),who admires forrest so much,he feels responsible for his death,and forrest's fussy secretary(richard whorf),who isn't what he seems to be. the young boy leads o'malley to christine forrest. o'malley expects christine to be well in her middle-age,but he's startled to see she isn't that old. christine isn't very helpful with the story;she's quite distant when o'malley asks her certain questions. o'malley also finds out that forrest's mother(margaret wycherly)is still living. her identity is near-hidden, so he decides to meet her. christine claims she's a mentally-disturbed invalid,but o'malley feels she knows more than she has been given credit for. meeting these people,o'malley comes to the startling realization that robert forest,a supposed \"american hero\",isn't such a great human being. the acting is vivid and realistic. katharine hepburn is excellent in the challenging role of a woman who knows what her husband was really like,but must be \"the keeper of the flame.\" spencer tracy is extremely effective as a reporter,who's beliefs have been shattered. the sparkling supporting cast makes the mystery even more intriguing. george cukor does a terrific job of directing by never having unnecessary scenes and building up the suspense slowly to make the ending have a lasting impression. cukor's work here foreshadows his work on the psychological dramas,\"gaslight\"(1944) and \"a double life\"(1947). the cinematography is stark and always draws the viewer's attention. the score is appropriately overpowering. the film has some similarities to the overrated,\"citizen kane.\"(1941) it's similar in that the main character is a deceased american figure,who's isn't what he seems to be. also,in both films,the main character lives in a dark,mysterious house. however,the viewer has sympathy for charles foster kane,whereas no one feels sorry for robert forrest. i recommend this film and give it a strong 8 1/2 out of 10.", "katharine hepburn reunites with two of her favorite men in film, director george cukor and offscreen honeybun spencer tracy, in this political noir thriller. it was kate and george's sixth film together and kate's second film with spence. in the follow up to the extremely well-received woman of the year, everything is a disappointment.in the film, kate's husband has died and the nation mourns the loss of one of their favorite war heroes. there's a gang of reporters who are anxious to write an inside scoop of the man's life, but kate won't see any of them. spencer tracy, a very famous reporter, literally hikes through the back woods and a waterfall to sneak into her home and ambush her. all the while, there's an underlying mystery that isn't particularly interesting or suspenseful; kate and the household staff keep trying to hide some sort of secret about her husband's past. kate herself thought the plot was boring, so if you start to nod off, don't feel too bad.my mom has a theory that actors do an impeccable job if you can't think of anyone else who could have played the part as well. well, as keeper of the flame was playing, in order to keep ourselves awake, my mom and i kept coming up with alternatives to the cast: loretta young, rosalind russell, cary grant, fred macmurray—the list goes on. my point is that neither actor, even though they looked convincingly in love with each other, added anything special to their roles. half the time, spencer tracy wore such a terrible glare it looked like he was about to murder his costars.on a sad note, van johson was on his way to see the film when he was involved in a terrible car accident that left him permanently scarred. they were in the middle of filming a guy named joe, and spencer tracy and irene dunne threatened to quit if van was replaced during his convalescence. a lifelong friendship was born.", "i can't understand the appeal of this movie- hepburn was so clearly acting you could almost hear george cukor's voice behind her lines. audrey christie was the only spark here. tracy was being tracy. the producers were too cowardly to make it more about lindbergh. you don't believe these characters for a second. i am not going to bore you with the reasons i don't like the film, but if you want to see how this film should have gone, see a movie called the great man with jose ferrer and one of the best casts in film. that is the best film about the unmasking of a 'hero' and exactly why. try to rent it and you will understand.", "no doubt its heart is in the right place, but this is a ludicrously bad movie. we have no idea why forrest was held in such near-universal adulation, particularly by the newspaperman o'malley who seems to have had little difficulty seeing through forrest's european counterparts.the dialogue is terrible - stilted and highfalutin from the outset before heading downhill, with tracy and hepburn making speeches ostensibly to each other but in fact to us.pleasure comes late in the piece when it starts to work as unintended comedy, christine's death being in the little nell class of guffaw-inducing departures.", "this 'classic' is a potboiler useful only for viewing some historic (old) actors and some young actors who became famous later.", "it was thursday evening and \"csi\"s on 'cbs' at 9 p.m. pdt. and there's a spencer tracy & katharine hepburn drama on 'tcm' (7 p.m.). one i haven't seen. it's \"keeper of the flame\" (1942) and i've considered watching it. the description looked pretty darn good but will the timing work out?tracy portrays steve o'malley a journalist who is assigned to write a biography of a beloved war hero who was accidentally killed in an auto-running-off-the-bridge accident. katharine hepburn is the widow forrest who has learned much about her deceased husband. at first stand-offish, christine doesn't want to help steve write the biography. her reasons are unknown. with as many odd and unusual people in the drama questions are popping up all over. o'malley, being the excellent journalist he is, has began to figure out things are not what they seem. why? if you get a chance you must see it. the ending has quite the twist.oh, btw, the timing was great...so was the movie", "the first hour of this movie is a bit of a slow burn but it's engaging and compelling. every character introduced, and developed, is relevant to the story. while it's a purely fictional story, the writing, directing and acting are all outstanding.spencer tracy plays a newspaper writer, steven o'malley, a man with unbreakable ethics and journalistic integrity- as he pursues the raw truth of about the life and death of a so-called american hero.the deceased hero, is a man named robert forrest. forrest is a man who was loved and admired by all who knew him. we are led to believe that robert forrest was killed in an unfortunate automobile accident. and for all intents and purposes, there's no reason to believe otherwise. however, as the story unfolds, questions begin to arise and secrets are revealed.the last 40 minutes of the film are fast-paced and quite gripping. when it all comes to a climax, the viewer is compelled to consider just how real this fictional story is to real life america. political drama and conspiracy, paired with action packed scenes, keep us engaged until the final minute.when we see \"the end\" on the screen, we already have questions running through our minds asking ourselves \"what if?\"it's a great movie and i believe it deserves a higher overall rating. i give it an 8.", "one of the more interesting features of this film is that much of it takes place outdoors, yet a lot of it is shot on the sound stages at mgm and on the back lot (the church used for the funeral sequence is the one at the end of the \"andy hardy\" street, for ex.) for the most part, this gives the film a kind of claustrophobic feeling which actually works in its favor. the rain, the lightning, even the trees, the sky, the bridge on the forest road, the cabin in the woods all seem fake - special effects, miniatures, cycloramas, sets - perfectly lit and shot to suggest the real thing, while also suggesting theatre. somehow a perfect setting for this drama with its theatrical intensity.cukor was an odd choice for this material, except that he had directed hepburn several times before and was probably her favorite director. he brings his usual sincerity to the work, focusing less on polemics as on the emotional toll forester's life and death has taken on his family and \"fans.\" again, the artificial sets and lighting, the shooting on back lot and sound stage, work extremely well to create the sense of an isolated, small community who worked and lived in forrest's shadow, either worshipful, fearful, or skeptical of his intense presence.what's very interesting is the way the man was perceived from afar, vs. close to home. i have often thought of this film when i've seen real-life heroes and wondered exactly what they're really like, what their home life is like, and how they really interact not with the masses but with the actual people around them. while most are not like forrest, it's still a good idea to keep the lessons this film brings up in mind.typically, cukor does not use the usual mgm stock company for his supporting cast but seems to try to find fresh faces. audrey christie appears here in her first film, for example, and percy kilbride has one of his first important roles. richard whorf and frank craven are other faces whose main experience was on the stage at that time.an absorbing film with a particularly great performance from tracy and another amazing one from the young darryl hickman.", "keeper of the flame marked the second teaming of tracy and hepburn, and was a box office hit, though reruns of it on tv in later years were not frequent. this is pretty potent stuff to begin with. it has a political slant and, even, producer louis b. mayer wasn't too fond of the project, but the underlying storyline is fascinating all the same.katherine hepburn's distinguished husband (and a possible future president) is killed in a car accident. spencer tracy plays the ambitious reporter covering the tragedy --digging up one too many skeletons in the man's past. as the nation mourns this military war hero, it turns out he's far from it. what a scoop!this has shades of the manchurain candidate (1962), to a degree, and may have inspired its author richard condon. a great question. george axelrod did the screenplay. keeper of the flame though is far more dark and moody (thunder and lightning), almost like an old dark house thriller, and just listen to that music score. also best filmed in black and white.do not miss beethoven's symphony number 3 in e flat major, which probably was in demand after the debut of this film.outstanding supporting cast, not to miss donald meek and frank craven, playing the doctor. applause for young darryl hickman as jeb, a dynamic child actor, in many other classic films.a one of a kind production, getting more airplay thanks to tcm and movies net. hepburn's favorite director, george cukor, handled this and it shows. cukor next directed gaslight. tracy and hepburn next starred in without love (1945), co-starring lucille ball.a film that will stay with you for awhile, and chances are you'll see it again. always on dvd and remastered blu ray for completists.", "this is a very controversial film since there are so many different aspects to it. it's both a political drama, a mystery thriller, a journalist's predicament of handling the truth, a great american tragedy and an interesting debunking of fascism. it is made in the most critical year of the war, it is definitely an ideological argument and taking a stand in the war although that is hardly mentioned and there are no political references, but it manages to delve into the darkness of manipulated politics to pinpoint the heart of the matter. what happened to robert forrest to make him change from an idealist and paragon for all democratic america into the opposite? what made saruman change from a white magician into a black? that is the real issue here, and there is no answer.the only one providing an answer is the mother, who blames the fall of robert forrest on his wife, he should never have married, and she is the first one to mention the word 'murder', but spencer tracy has to discard her as insane. however, no other explanation is offered anywhere in the film.spencer tracy seeks out katharine hepburn, the widow of robert forrest, to write the story of his life and make it the eulogy of a hero. the widow readily accepts him and will cooperate fully, since she has no objection to the maintenance of her husband's glory and legend. but the journalist is not satisfied and realizes something is deliberately concealed from him. that's why he spites the widow to visit the mother on his own, and that's where the drama of the film starts. the more you dig for the truth, the worse it stinks, they say, and although you ultimately find the truth here, the film does not tell the whole story. the journalist tells the story for sure, but the key to the issue is never revealed or explained: how did it happen that such a glorious hero turned from idealism to opportunistic power madness? what made him change his mind and bring about his own fall? was it only pride, vanity and egoism? someone tries to hint at that for an explanation, that he lost god for egoism, but he was a clever and intelligent man, and it is never explained how he could get caught in such a trap.a critic says the portrait and case of robert forrest was modelled on charles lindbergh, but that is very far-fetched, and there are only vague parallels - lindbergh never had political ambitions, although he clearly sympathized with fascism and racism. racism is not mentioned here, fascism only perfunctorily, while the problems here are entirely human.i saw this film some 12 years ago and was impressed, i greatly looked forward to seeing it again for a closer look and found it an entirely different film. that tells something of its complexities.", "must- see scene at about 1:30 with katharine hepburn - it's truly chillingly applicable to our times regarding trump and his conies in 2019. fascism. you should see the whole film, though i found it dragging a bit in the beginning. the acting and production is superb. wow, just wow.", "just saw this film for the first time on tcm. unbelievably relevant for today. a cautionary tale in the age of trumpism.", "tracy & hepburn at mgm in keeper of the flame (1942), their 2nd movie together, out of a career total of 9. director is george cukor from a screenplay by donald ogden stewart, two years after their collaboration with hepburn on philadelphia story. cinematographer wm. h. daniels owes a huge debt of gratitude to citizen kane, made just the year before, and that's a big plus for this story. i'd never seen keeper of the flame before. i've been watching and re-watching a number of hepburn movies lately, and when i saw a dvd of this at the library i took it home with me. it is hard-hitting, gripping, well made, and, most important of all, it is surprisingly and tellingly resonant today for a movie made more than 80 years ago (granted it was made during wartime). supporting cast includes richard whorf, audrey christie, margaret wycherly, forrest tucker, frank craven, howard da silva, percy kilbride, stephen mcnally, donald meek and the 11-year-old darryl hickman--network (1976), the tingler (1959), tea and sympathy (1956), the grapes of wrath (1940) and hundreds of tv programs--in an exceptionally strong performance for a child actor at that time (or really any time). performances are uniformly excellent. twenty years ago i might have said the ending is heavy-handed, but now i don't think it is. highly recommended. a warning (my usual warning, but very much on point in this case): do not under any circumstances read anything about the plot of this movie beforehand, do not look at the trailer, do not even glance at the summaries on a dvd box. close your eyes to all that. it's much better if you don't know where the story is going, and the trailer and everything else i've since read about it reveal way too much. a footnote on hickman: his younger brother was dwayne hickman of dobie gillis tv fame and darryl also appeared on that show. if you've never seen keeper of the flame you're in for a good sit. tracy and hepburn, two of the best actors who ever lived, are in top notch form. terrific movie."]}

attracted a lot of nonsensical comments, mostly from left of center commentators; and it's sadly revealing how the facts cited by other viewers are not even addressed, but simply ignored by the left-ist commentators. those who accuse the film of being anti-communist propaganda mostly use ad hominem arguments, and insult and invective. but ask yourself: what good is a political view which assumes itself (because it is self-described as \"revolutionary\") to be above ordinary moral or political criticism? if that were true, then there could never be any way to judge the value of the actions performed in its name. in short, this is a reasonably good film, with a fine performance by kate nelligan, and much less good work by other members of the cast. the direction is not inspired, and the flashback structure of the film seeks to maximize the emotional effects without stopping to consider just how powerful those effects are all by themselves, that is, the use of that structure betrays the fear of the film-makers that the story might not have the impact they wanted it to have. the original book is stronger, but it too is flawed by nicholas gage's failure to ask himself about how it was that the communists picked on his mother, even though he presents some of the evidence that answers the question. it's clear from the book that some members of his family -- i think his grandfather, but it's been a long time since i read the book -- had serious disputes with other people in the village in the 20s and 30s and perhaps even earlier, and that there may even have been a murder involved; naturally, gage is not all that clear on the point. the communists, men, most of them, couldn't go after the grandfather, so, brave souls that they were, went after the most vulnerable: the gage womenfolk. despicable, but that is often the tenor of village and peasant life. and to me, this was the message of the book, that the politics of revolution were, in many cases, simply another weapon in the never-ending village war between its own members. the problem with the film is that it never really clarifies this central aspect of the drama, and so the power of nelligan's performance is marooned. it affects, but it's almost in a vacuum, and malkovich's portrayal of gage, which i thought quite good, is similarly detached; but the flaw lay in the original book, which ducks important questions because gage, north american that he is, simply doesn't understand the deeper currents of village life. worth a look, no matter its flaws. no work of art is ever perfect, and this one gets high marks for trying.", "this is another of those supposedly based-on-a-true story accounts, this one dealing with a man's (writer nicholas gage) quest to return to his native greece and avenge his mother's death which occurred 30 years earlier.this is not an uplifting story but it's not depressing, either.....but it is grim. it begins with the grecian mother protecting her kids from the vicious communisits of the late 1940s. the film switches back and forth from that period to modern-day but it's never disjointed. the acting by john malkovich, kate nelligan and linda hunt is excellent and the scenery is pleasing and very little, if any, profanity if memory serves me. it's a decent film but not anything i'd watch more than once.", "great movie, with a good performance from kate nelligan. cant believe all the people defending communist kidnappers and murderers, after all the years of nazi murders, people actually defend thugs kidnapping children, murdering villagers who refused to agree with them, etc, etc, etc.... the greek civil war was nothing more than stalin trying to add greece to his list of appetizers along with poland, hungary, romania, bulgaria, etc... stealing children to take behind the iron curtain, executing parents who try to keep their own children, stealing houses, livestock and food crops to feed the murderers of their own people is not a good thing and this movie sends that message in spades. people are supposed to be happy about being out from under the fascist murderers and put under the domination of communist ones???????", "stunning performances by kate nelligan and most of the cast in this powerful story, based on truth, help make this a must-see film.i wonder if some of the reviewers, such as onceuponatime500, really saw the movie, or if they just wrote from some vicious and preconceived bias.the communists come to the village to conscript -- kidnap -- children to become guerrilla fighters. the mother, eleni, takes a drastic step, mutilating her oldest child to spare her from being shanghaied into the communist forces.being communists, they will not be thwarted, not by any such reactionary notions as self-ownership, or freedom, or parental rights, or any of that silly stuff: they take the next oldest girl instead.eleni loves her children and believes, foolishly according to onceuponatime500, but in line with what charlie anderson (james stewart) in \"shenandoah\" said: they're my children, not the state's, not some murderous movement's.for years after seeing this powerful and haunting story, i could recall nelligan's last scene and be moved to tears.the agony eleni went through was duplicated millions of times in the bloody 20th century, as some government or another, or some tyrannical movement or another, kidnapped young people to force them to risk their lives for some cause most of them didn't understand, much less support.think viet cong, think hitler's armies, think stalin's and mao's imperialist and aggressive armies, and, yes, think of the poor draftees from the united states.think, contrastingly, of parents, parents who spent years loving and caring for their children, hoping those children would be able to live to a better adulthood than their parents. think of those parents seeing their children sometimes literally torn from their grasp, thrown into lines to be cannon fodder for cruel warlords -- communists, nazis, imperialists of one kind or another, even when disguised as crusaders.\"eleni\" works at almost every level except for the incredibly horrible performance by john malkovich. if it hadn't been seen as anti-communist, even hollywood would have honored \"eleni.\" but its being anti-communist made \"eleni\" an outcast in that artistically and morally corrupted town. however, \"eleni\" is powerful drama.added 25 november 2017: watching \"eleni\" on youtube, i am wondering if my dislike of john malkovich's performance is at least as much for how unpleasant he makes nick gage. as portrayed by malkovich, gage is rude, cold, aloof; he has no personality, doesn't respond to people, not even to his wife who asks questions. as performed by malkovich, gage's personality is enough to chase away a viewer.we are now exactly 100 years after the bolshevik revolution in russia, an event that led to hundreds of millions of deaths, and destruction of entire nations, of entire peoples. there is an irony in nick gage's working for the new york times, which has been frequently pro-communist, and nearly always anti-anti- communist, with its moscow correspondent walter duranty infamously painting a rosy picture of the soviet union during the time of the murderous monster josef stalin.this century anniversary makes \"eleni\" even more poignant and even more important.", "i weep because my family is portrayed in this film. it reminds me of the pain they went through but refused to speak about. a story that received no fanfare but brought pain to many. i see through the eyes of the director and the words of nick gage what they went through. a beautiful, love letter to a strong mother.", "as another reviewer wrote, this is a movie about a family, not about politics - even though it is terror that causes that family to be harmed. as the mother, kate nelligan is absolutely superb, shining, wonderful. as the son as an adult, john malkovich is curiously detached. again, although the movie was first rate, i question the decision to alternate time periods with a parallel narratives throughout. i think it lessens the impact. i see no reason the story couldn't be told chronologically, to greater effect. those two reviewers from argentina and greece who wrote that the movie was propaganda are being silly. neither this movie nor anyone denies that the communists (and those democrats defending the former king and government who had returned to power after the war - the king wishing to reign but not rule) fought the nazis during the second world war. this movie does not take place during that war - and doesn't refer to it. further, when the second world war ended, there were no native greek fascists fighting in the civil war - when a reviewer writes that this was a fascist war, it's crazy. in the movie, you hear the communists using the term, \"fascist\" in the same loose propagandistic way that, say, prime minister tony blair is referred to as a fascist - falsely. as the soviet union's proxies looked to be gaining in the civil war, britain asked the united states to participate in an effort to aid the greek government with financial aid and weapons. over this and the communist insurgency in turkey, was the truman doctrine of containment of communist totalitarianism born. these are simply facts. moreover, the fact that the greek communists took tens of thousands of children from their parents and shipped them off to communists countries such as albania and czechoslovakia is obviously well-documented in the book and movie. however, as i wrote above, the movie simply looks at a human story of a mother and her love for her children. kate nelligan makes the movie heartfelt, moving, powerful. she should have won the oscar for this performance.", "this movie vilified,mostly by communists, because it exposes the truth of how they were pensioned for their war crimes, is also a deeply moving true story about a mothers love and sacrifice, and a son seeking justice. it depicts the true collaboration of communists, in the region, to take over greece at the close of world war 2, rather than the propaganda that they fought the nazis. in brutal detail new york times writer nicholas cage exposes the 'good' life granted to these war criminals, by the then 'socialist' government years later when it came to power. he searches for the murderers, and when he finds them, his decision not to stoop to their level is powerful. great performances by john malkovich as nicholas cage, and kate nelligan as eleni.", "i haven't seen the whole movie, only some parts. i must though make some observations. i think it would be too innocent for someone to believe that films, any kind of films - from \"judge dredd\" to \"bowling for columbine\"-,do not embrace certain ideas, do not have a very specific and clear ideology. ihave read the comments on this movie and to be honest i am a bit annoyed by some of these which happen to be a part of my country;s history. it is never easy to view things in a civil war, it is very clear though that in the greek civil war(1945-1949)there were two sides; there was the former government, which during the triple occupation(german, italian and bulgarian)was \"absent\" in cairo (just to note that the former government handed over those communists who were then in exile to the nazis) and there was the people,who were starving to death, who were tortured, who were sent to concentration camps or to factories in germany to work. the two sides are very distinct and so were the interests each side served. when greece was liberated by the germans, the former government came back to claim the power. the people fought against them, not just the communists, for they wanted a free country, where the people would be the one to decide for its fate and not some so-called allied forces!if it hadn't been for the english and the american, greece would have been a totally different country. let me just say that thanks to the american and english intervention the first napalm bombs were first tested here, in greece, against the communists and those who fought for dignity and for an independent nation. now concerning the film, when these \"allied forces\" are described as liberators and when the communists are described as the biggest threat in human history, i am sorry to disappoint some of you but this is a clear political view!!and i am also sorry to disappoint some of you but since we live in capitalism(don't be afraid to use the word!), which is an economical and political system, we shouldn't believe that art, culture, our everyday habits are not a reflection of this particular system. besides every system tries to protect itself! finally, i would like to add that i do like films and i do like art, but i don't like to be manipulated in a way that my personal judgment is put aside. ps one last observation concerning history facts and propaganda: in \"la vita e bella\" starring roberto benini, the last scene shows american troops liberating the prisoners of the concentration camp in poland!well, i guess 20.000.000 russian killed in the second world war would be quite surprised, if not anything else.", "an excellent film, especially for history buffs. i suggest that anyone who has seen this film should also read the book. as a former leftist, this movie hits home regarding the lies and distortions that communists use to perpetuate their evil and inhuman ideology. as an american of greek descent, i am familiar with many of the traditions and customs shown in the film. the village life shown caused me to recall stories that my mother told me, and the closeness of the family in greek culture shown by the protagonist's relentless search for his mother's killers is another accurate portrayal. the starvation and suffering of poor greeks during wwii made them easy prey for communist ideology, which, thank god, did not succeed in 1945-1949, and thanks to works like this film, will never succeed.", "other people commenting on this film complain about its being mere propaganda against communism and supporting fascism. what a lot of baloney. it's about mothers and children, and about how, no matter what kind of brawl is going on, the men run to the hills, leaving the women and children behind to be brutalized. and it's about how one woman lost her life because she refused to give her children up to the state, no matter who that state was.", "...50 years after the end of greek civil war which have cost much more lives than the wwii (most of them leftish people), a greek-american boy which became a man (?) adds his punchline to the right-wing everlasting propaganda. a successful film of a successful book, which only place should be the trash-bin along with other propaganda products of the cold war. an utter insult to the thousands men and women greek partisans who fought against the nazis and for our freedom, and -unfortunately- lost...", "powerful performances all around in this tale of a family's struggle to escape the greek civil war after world war ii. based on a true story, and with a powerful performance by kate nelligan as the title character. john malkovich does not disappoint as her son who seeks to avenge his mother's execution. oscar winner linda hunt also gives a fine supporting performance. a gripping, suspenseful mystery!", "does it really writes 28,000 greek children or my eyes are lying me?? the majority of the children were not of greek origin! majority of those children and their descendants live now in poland, australia, canada, ex yugoslavia etc. and declare themselves as macedonians. i heard their stories many times because my grandparents are one of them! they never said that were kidnapped by communists! i found it very disturbing to call them greeks because they never felt greeks! children were forced to leave their homes because of greek fascist regime... those children and we, descendants of them declare themselves only as macedonians and not greeks. we also speak dopika...from where did dopika come and how we learned it if not from our grandparents? dopika is not a greek language btw... this movie is a poor propaganda. those people are alive, do not insult them with saying they are greeks....", "i don't generally award 10 stars. but this true account of a mother's struggle in post-war greece has haunted me for over twenty years. since becoming a parent myself, i have often thought of her great sacrifice. it is a great mystery to me why this fantastic film has virtually disappeared from circulation. it's one of the most perfectly realized films you'll come across. the acting, direction, and photography are superb. it's worth owning just for bruce smeaton's brilliantly unique musical score. i've tried, without success, to find greek music in a similar vein. much of the opposition to the film in 1985 came from critics who insinuated an anti-marxist political bias. they missed the point. the film depicts the story of a mother removed from the political machinations that are grinding around her. eleni wasn't a reactionary, she was a loving mother. unless film buffs rediscover \"eleni\" the hollywood left will have buried a beautiful gem, which conflicts with their accepted version of history. goodnight and good luck.", "this unbelievably reactionary piece of garbage actually glorifies a traitor to the greek people who supported the fascists in the civil war. the mother who is the supposed \"hero\" even purposefully maims her daughter at one point to prevent her from fighting on the side of the freedom fighters! (i'm not kidding! this is portrayed as \"positive\"! what will they do for a sequel: do a film glorifying child abusers in general?) the protagonist in the film stalks a former leader in the resistance in greece and carries a gun with him intending to kill him. this unbelievable concoction of lies and nonsense is shameful and there is nothing that can be said that is bad enough about the film and the people who made it. showing it comes awfully close to being a hate crime, in my opinion. zero stars", "i'm well aware that the word \"powerful\" has been used to describe \"eleni\" innumerable times...yet it seems the closest word to describe the indescribable. based on a true story and historical events (namely the civil war in greece), the film captures a family's struggle in the harsh realities of war, communism and inhumanity...at the hands of people who are the closest to us. eleni not only delves into the lives of greek peasants, but attempts to give us a glimpse into their personal background and even mindset as to why they let certain events unfold. certain actions and decisions that normal, rational people born outside of greek culture would think impossible or inhumane begin to make sense, and while most viewers will never agree to what is happening, they can at least sympathize. this well-written story is spectacularly filmed (in spain) and with an incredible musical score-- eleni is one of the most underrated films of its genre, on par with dr zhivago. unfortunately, the character of nick is played by john malcovich...who is grievously miscast for this role (in hindsight it may have been solely to get at least a known hollywood name attached to the project) and his monotone, lifeless style comes off as neither greek nor appropriate for such an emotional story-- linda hunt, by contrast is amazing. eleni should absolutely be in the repertoire of any film enthusiast.", "it is clear from some of the more glowing reviews that this film tends to be judged by its value as a true story, and i will take the same approach.zero stars. anyone who knows anything about the greece of the 40s can recognise gage's book about his mother for the cynical money spinner that it is. the film dishes up the same claptrap.the much-maligned elas was the only effective resistance organisation in greece. it was loved and supported by the majority of greeks, due to its commitment to the fight against fascism, its strict discipline and its respect for the rights and needs of the greek people. its founder ares velouchiotis became a legend in his own time, a byword for military genius, toughness and fairness, with numerous songs composed about him even before his death. after the british handed greece over to the collaborators, the criminal classes and the pusillanimous, civil war was inevitable. eventually greek children were moved across the border to escape the napalm that was being dropped on them by america, but with parental approval. as gage concedes, eleni was executed by elas for treachery, and her name is still hated in her village today.", "this is not a comment to the movie itself. the bits i have seen show at least an accurate portrayal of rural greece in the late 40's along with the political \"turmoil\" of the time. acting was above average in general, although some members of the cast, notably malkovich, could have done a slightly better job.so, is this propaganda? of course it is but with more grains of truth than your average propaganda film, especially an american made. yes, mr gatzoyannis (unless he is ashamed to use his real family name and resorts to \"gage\") had lost his mother during the civil war. he is supposed to be one-sided, who wouldn't? he wrote a book about it, good for him. someone made a film based on it, good for them. and now, many of us are bickering about what it is, propaganda or not, who are the good and who are the bad ones and so on...a commentator before said that war is the end of civilization. true! a civil war though makes an \"ordinary\" war look quite civilized and \"noble\". americans surely have their experience, they have gone through a terrible civil war. we, greeks, have our experience which, sadly, is more \"fresh\" - lots of people that lived through it are still around to talk about it. kids being taken from their mothers' arms to be transported..where? brother killing brother (literally!) and generally bringing down whatever was once dear. who's the bad guy? which brother gets moral high ground? the one who took to mountains, kidnapped young ones to put them through a grim life behind the iron curtain, laid waste to his land and his home? or the other, who after suffering all that, imprisoned those left behind (the majority of which were not part of the armed struggle and suffered along too), exiled them to desolate barren islands (there are more than we need of those in the aegean), made them \"dance\" with cats in a sack (interesting how democracy, or \"democracy\", can be as horrendous as communism or any other totalitarian regime) and generally held them at the \"border\" of society until 1974. who gets praise and who gets blame? you don't know? i think you do! history was always written by victors, this is no exception. what is an exception in this case is that this particular \"victor\" (gage) abstained his country's drama until it \"suited\" him to be a part of it. having lost a loved one, a parent, in war is no unique to him, millions of people did! did he live the ongoing \"plague\" that the civil war was? from the comfort of his house, half a world away. it is almost as if i, who have never been to the us, write a book about the drama of the indians. whatever moral high ground he possessed he lessened being that \"distanced\" from the whole scenery of it and its consequences. in short, this book and film portray his side, not his ideology's side but his personal side. it is easy to place blame, very hard to do so for one side only! i will not go into the politics of that period, that is for another place and another time. decent film, worth a viewing if not for anything else for an accurate portrayal of the \"scenery\". no stars awarded as i have not seen it all, just bits and pieces.", "it's amazing man's capacity to inflict harm upon each other for any whimsical reason just so long as you give it a noble title like war or freedom. during the greek civil war the communist party was fighting for the people's freedom. that freedom paradoxically took the form of oppression and repression. the greek civil war was yet another war in the history of wars and as always, the people paid the price. those with the lofty titles and ideals remain unscathed while the rank and file pay mightily.eleni \"americana\" katsianas (sp?) (kate nelligan) was one of the rank and file that paid mightily and her son, nikola (john malkovich), sought to find the truth of her death some 30 years later. he was driven to know what happened to his mother after she helped him escape.the overriding story was a greek civil war, but the more focused message was what a mother would do to protect her children. eleni put it succinctly when she said, \"they took our food. they took our home. they took my dignity. and i gave it, i gave it at every turn, but i will not give them my children.\" and she made the ultimate sacrifice for her children. she gave her life so that they wouldn't be forced to fight for \"the people.\"director peter yates used a format of skipping back and forth between present day and 30 years ago to paint us a picture. through that we saw nikola's motivation for finding and possibly punishing the men that executed his mother. nikola was no vigilante, in fact he was the bureau chief for the new york times, but who knows what animus he had towards the fiends who killed his mother.\"eleni\" tears the heart to shreds and kate nelligan was the sharp instrument that did the shredding. she tapped into the soul of her character. she breathed fire into the character eleni and brought her to life. oh, why are some the most powerful moments also the saddest?", "i think this movie has been underrated, for some disappointing reasons. very few people criticize kate nelligan's fine performance; but they overlook the performances of linda hunt and the actor who played the local communist leader who was ultimately spared by nicholas gage (i don't know his name, but i thought the casting was quite deft). for the most part, though, it was john malkovich's performance that has been so grossly misunderstood. people hadn't seen enough of his work in 1985 when the movie came out. but now, after \"places in the heart,\" \"the killing fields,\" and numerous other films, we should be able to appreciate what he can do with a part.another distressing aspect of the critical comments is the fact that the political left prefers to focus on political background as the major point in their evaluation. to toss out any political reference to the actual situation in greece in the late 1940's is nothing more than turning the very valid allegations of communist mischief in that time into an argument for their side--something that the radical left has always been able to do quite adroitly for some time. in the early '80's many of those kidnapped children had grown up and returned to greece--as agents provocateurs. they were so successful that their efforts had a potent effect on greek politics for years. it is a fact that in that time the soviets shot down a korean airliner that had drifted off course over the sea of japan. everyone aboard was killed. and the premier of greece, with no evidence to support his conclusion whatsoever, said publicly that the plane was probably on a spy mission for the cia. he, of course, was playing to the powerful leftist political sentiment in his own country at the time. a page of history is truly worth a volume of logic sometimes.", "the movie really belongs to the trash bin-same as the book. good old american propaganda. as for those who are not greeks but know exactly what happened in that war i really doubt that they do. the term \"fascist\" is commonly used in greece for all right-wing people, even \"mild\" right-wing people, if such a thing exists. does that ring any bells to you? it is really worth spending some time studying about the civil war in greece(1945-1949). it really is the epitomy of us (and british) involvement in the internal affairs of every country and if you change the names and dates it can be just as good for spain, korea, el salvador, colombia, venezuela, nicaragua, bolivia, cuba, vietnam, somalia, kosovo, afghanistan, iraq etc etc (the list is infinite) the epitomy of foreign us policy itself!being evil is easy. being good is tough. choose your path or be a zero!", "a story about the love of family and how strong political opinions can make people monsters, helped by personal gains.found the back and forth in time a little confusing.the scenery and settings were beautiful and convincing, the actual scenes were heart wrenching and i felt the agony of the characters.i was so sad that it wasn't possible to watch this in greece (but was able to watch abroad), because of the fanaticism of the supporters of a certain political group.the 1945 to 1949 civil war in greece still raises heavy debates, partly because the communists lost and the losers seem to attract some sympathy from ordinary people.", "whitewashing the victors of the greek civil war (nazi collaborators, monarchists and all those traitors) is a direct insult to the greek resistance (primarily, but not only, communists) who saved the greek people from famine during occupation and shed their blood in the fight against the germans and their local lackeys. while members of nazi collaborating \"security battalions\" who were taking an oath to hitler, not only went unpunished but were also reinstated and rearmed to fight against the resistance the real heroes, the members of eam-elas who bled to free the country were imprisoned, tortured and facing execution squads by the british-led monarcho- fascists. really cheap propaganda. total garbage, might as well have been financed by the cia. too bad i can't give 0 stars.", "i have seen this movie and it is very gripping and entertaining, unfortunately it does not tell the whole story of greece and what the resistance actually was and who they were fighting. in particular this story is one that as usual suffers from lies of omission and the simplification of very complex political issues into good vs. evil. perhaps eleni was faced with an evil leader of the left, however do we know who and why the left was actually fighting. quickly, greece had a king and aristocracy that was controlled by a military dictator before wwii, greece was pivotal to british interests in egypt (suez canal and middle east oil -iran) and basically great britain backed this military dictator. when wwii broke out the king and dictator fled and it was the greek people who fought the germans and italians, england actually fought with them at the end also. problem, average greek person did not want king or fascist dictator back (this is the communist group - which they were really leftist not stalin communist). greeks wanted to govern themselves and this is not what great britain - they wanted king and dictator back and guess who won . the king came back until the late 50's and 60's were greek people won their independence. on mean idiot that was communist does not mean that all of the things the left was fighting for were wrong - this is pure and simple propaganda.", "this is a surprisingly realistic film about the era in greece. the film is well directed, it is direct and you can't take a break. highly recommended", "i read the book years ago and the book spent more time talking about what was going on in the home and why eleni didn't leave - specifically talking about his sisters getting married and their possessions.i'd have liked the movie to have touched more on who eleni was and her thought process but i'm guessing there was a time constraint.the movie was good but focused most on the communists who took over lia and how the family lived under this harsh occupation. the betrayal by various villagers wasn't something that was explained (ex: anna) and it makes you absolutely furious. this movie will make you feel nothing but rage at the injustice eleni faced.", "the first shot of this film came on screen, and i honestly thought, 'this might not be too bad'. i was wrong though, because the opening shot here is the only shot in this entire movie which looks anything more than mediocre. the framing is bland and there clearly wasn't much thought or effort put into it, as most scenes here are just presented in bland, uninspired shot reverse shot. this thing is mostly ugly to be honest, and the few shots that aren't just look boring at best. the production design comes off as pretty cheap, and even the costumes look awful and unconvincing. the editing is probably the only element of this movie that isn't a complete dumpster fire, but even then a lot of it is really obnoxious and amateur.almost every aspect of eleni is terrible, but the most especially terrible aspect of it is the acting and script. john malkovich is in this movie for some reason, and it's very clear that this is one of his first roles, because he does a fairly abysmal job here. he really just seems bored the entire time, and there isn't a single moment in this film where he presents any emotion whatsoever. but my biggest issue with him is that he shouldn't be in the movie. this film constantly cuts between eleni and malkovich's character, and i truly believe that it would be far better if you cut out all of his scenes. this movie has a runtime of one hour and fifty four minutes in total, and since john's subplot only takes up twenty minutes of it, you could easily cut it out and still have a feature length film, because his story-line adds nothing to the main one with eleni, and, until the climax at least, nothing even happens in it anyway. and i have to say, that climax is one of the most cliche'd, cheesy and underwhelming ones i have ever seen in a film.but while john malkovich seems bored, kate nelligan seems like she's trying too hard, and she fails miserably. her story-line isn't as terrible as johns, but that's not saying much because it's still basically unbearable to watch. the dialogue here is poorly written to the point where it's embarrassing, as most of this films conversations are either just insanely forced attempts at exposition, or even more forced attempts at being 'deep', and oh wow is it cheesy. the amount of unearned emotion in this film is genuinely unbelievable, as there are so many moments here which are clearly trying to make the audience cry, but they fail because they're so sappy and don't feel earned. like maybe the time spent on john malkovich walking around and doing nothing interesting should've been spent on actual character development.overall, there's a reason why eleni only has one hundred and eighty eight ratings on letterboxd: it's terrible. don't watch this boring, unengaging, annoying, forgettable, cliched, sappy and unsubtle piece of garbage, unless if you're looking for a film so incompetent it's hilarious, in which case this may not be a bad choice.", "isn't it strange that this movie was never screened in greece? greece where communists had lost the civil war and were hunted down like pests. it's all but a fairy-tale made by a man so that he may relieve himself from anger and sadness. hollywood did a fine job transforming it to anti-communist propaganda. technically a pretty decent movie.", "while the general storyline was moving and probably based on a series of true events, i had to believe that it was primarily made as an anti-communist piece of propaganda.having said that, i did enjoy the film and the style in which it was directed.", "the book relies a lot on the claim the author intended to commit murder.all we know is that he killed no one.i find it suspicious.and the film leaves out a lot of the background.no real insights into greek life.", "i saw the film, and i cannot believe it. it turns a social process, a revolution, into a comedy. is criminal to speak this way about a fight, where lot of people died, and most of them were communist. the poverty of greece was the cause of the guerrilla, not the badness of a couple of crazy guys. the \"coup d´etat\" that came after confirms that things happened different... is very hard hearing the mother screaming for his sons, but that´s only usa propaganda."]}

heading for a small, desolate town on the edge of the gobi desert. a pack of stray dogs charges towards it, scaring the driver and tipping over the bus. out of it comes lang, an ex-convict who used to be a popular stunt motorcyclist, now returning to his hometown after 10 years in prison for the murder of a local gangster's nephew. a few conversations with the police later, the title card appears, and the magic of black dog begins. a poetic and minimalist film of healing and moving on, portrayed through a friendship, a bond, a spiritual connection between man and dog. the man is lang, and the dog is the infamous thin black dog that has been terrorizing the town. rumored of carrying rabies, the black dog goes around defending his territory by pissing on walls and biting people, so everyone is out to catch him.black dog is a story of two lonely strays caged by a world that does not understand them. two lost souls alienated by the society around them. two black sheep who do not fit in. lang is marginalized because of his past as a \"murderer\", and the black dog is also alienated amongst the other strays for being the biggest, strongest, fastest and most aggressive of all the dogs. one of guan hu's main messages in black dog is that no animal is evil. humans can be, but dogs cannot. stray dogs are violent because they're in constant fear, trying to survive in an evolving environment where they do not belong. lang is similar to a stray dog. he's not like the others. he only says a few words in the whole film as he's very quiet and introverted. like the black dog, he's trying to make a life for himself in a town that's in the process of modernization. after his time in prison, lang has changed, and so did the town and the people he once knew. so now, he doesn't speak, he only exists and goes with the flow. that's why lang and the black dog are so perfect for each other and why they instantly connected-they're both just trying to survive in a world they no longer know, a world that no longer wants them.black dog is set during an important time for china, a time of urbanization and change. and this little town is impacted deeply. most of its residents have fled, leaving their dogs behind, who now roam free in the streets and in the desert hills. the zoo is running out of money to sustain the animals, so they too are freed in the desert. the circus is trying to survive, but business hasn't been good. the old is being demolished to make way for the new, which is a clever pararell with the ending of the film, where the black dog dies but leaves behind a new generation of black puppies. the cinematography of black dog is gorgeous, with guan hu adopting the new \"slow-cinema\" chinese style of bi gan, which made me fall in love with the film almost instantly. long, panoramic shots of beautiful landscapes, quiet scenes of motorcycle rides and slow walks through dusty roads and desolate rural villages, are all complemented with a lonesome atmosphere.scenes like lang and the black dog calmly passing through the desert's stray dogs, and the solar eclipse sequence with the zoo's tiger wandering the town's streets freely, are two of my favorite of the entire year so far. and the final shot of black dog is so beautiful and meaningful. through his canine companion, lang finally learns how to keep on living despite his dark past, and how to find happiness within life's miseries. the pink floyd soundtrack gives a certain nostalgia to guan hu's relaxing images, and the acting performances are absolutely stellar, human and animal alike, from eddie peng to the black dog named xiao xin, and the majestic tiger. just the fact that eddie peng developed such a strong bond with xiao xin while filming that he felt he had to adopt him afterwards, is a beautiful real-life illustration of the message of this wonderful film. a melancholic and meditative journey of finding your place in the world through friendship, and a genuine tribute to man's best friend, black dog is simply one of the best films of the year, and proof that chinese arthouse cinema is still very much alive.", "i had no idea idea what to expect when i saw this movie. it was slow moving but fully engrossing. it is set amongst a somewhat grim environment but really opened my eyes to how people exist in some parts of china. it is an austere existence, barren and treeless yet the town is gearing up for the 2008 beijing olympics with propaganda blasted over the loudspeakers in true communist china fashion.although it is a sobering film, there are several parts that are quite humorous and while it isn't heavy on dialogue, it is what not is said that makes you think.i can see what this was a winner at cannes.", "\"lang\" (eddie peng) has returned to his hometown after a term in prison. we learn a little more about the causes of that and of his distant relationship with his zoo-keeping father as the story develops, as well as discovering that he once was one of the place's more famous citizens being in a popular local band. with the beijing olympiad (2008) looming large, there is quite an emphasis for the government on tarting the place up - and that signals quite significant \"improvements\" for their home on the edge of the gobi desert. much of it has already been earmarked for demolition, and with most of the heart (and soul) of the place already removed, the authorities turn their attention to the serious problem of hundreds of feral dogs marauding around potentially spreading rabies. there is one particularly skinny black one that is worth 1000 yuan if it can be caught, and that's the target for the motor-cycling \"lang\". thing is, this mutt is no mug, and is soon doing more of the chasing (and biting). one particularly embarrassing nibble sees both confined to his home in quarantine and that's when the bonds begin to become established and we also realise the extent of hostility felt by some to this man. with the bulldozers never far away, his ailing dad's zoo no longer able to care for it's tenants and the vengeful butcher \"hu\" (hu xiaoguang) and his thugs out for revenge, we settle into a tale of this newfound friendship that's quite engaging. it's predictable in stages, but it's really the largely dialogue-free effort from peng set against a backdrop of relentless winds, dust and trains rolling through the increasingly lifeless town that gives this a bit of potency. it's not so much that the town is being cleared because of the olympics, though that's clearly on director hu guan's mind, it's that why was a town ever here in this inhospitable place in the place? it's bleak and forlorn, a concrete oasis in the middle of nowhere and that setting works well as the man himself comes across as lonely, detached as well as emotionally and physically rootless. it's a slow watch, but not one that drags, for two hours and it rather effectively sums up an existence of mundanity, lack of opportunity and a desire for a true sense of freedom quite well. be warned, not a great deal happens - but i did enjoy it.", "this movie is not what i have expected. i was forced to sit through it with a very uninteresting viewing experience. the screen play is quite boring, loosely knitted together with no energy, no steam at all, but just a lifeless narration. what we saw in this movie is a dying town in the northern china, the livelihood is totally gone after the mining business died. what left is a pathetic town with so many ruined and empty buildings, just like what we saw in flint, indiana. the leading character, the protagonist as movie critics or veteran reviewers used to describe, peng, seems to be an bad choice for such ex-con character, a complete out-of-the-place actor to play this role. his dialogue in this movie is minimum in order to portray that this guy is a loner who belongs to nowhere, even in prison, albeit his so-called hometown. there is not much to tell in this movie, and i really failed to see how the director of this movie would have won some nominations as the best director. maybe less is more is the current trendy. making a black stray dog as the co-acting role is just not interested enough to stimulate my urge that would give me any passion or empanthy to the whole storyline. i felt quite impatient when i watched this movie. all of the characters who appeared in this movie, those folks, young or old, cops or civilians who tried to get by in a dying town are interested enough, just like their boring dialogue to each other, to the leading role who looked more like a half dumb or deaf person. if a town is dying, if all the town folks are poor, if all of them lose hope, if their daily lives are all so boring, what would enable to make a movie interesting? even you put a seasoned actor like peng to play the leading character, how much he could possibly make this boring town with so many boring town folks become a bit more interesting? a spiritless young man and a black stray dog is as boring as hemingway's \"the old man and the sea\", other than somewhat literary values that usually was glorified as \"literature\". trying to tell you that \"black dog\" has certain philosophic depth is just a pretentious view that tries to look deep. how could you get anything out of nothing?", "a beautiful, slow-burn, and memorizing tale of the grim environment of the rural parts of china with strong performances, direction, writing, and structure. filmmaker guan hu achieves with exploring the relationship between man and dog from a chinese perspective and filled with gorgeous camerawork, sound designs, and interesting narrative choices, it brings out the realism, engagement, and examination of the characters in a nature way.with little dialogue, the sobering approach, art-house pacing, and style really brings the narrative into a whole new light. the performances from eddie peng and the rest of the cast are great and many of the characters, while some characters could have been explored a little better. i appreciate the movie on exploring about dogs, humanism and society without a biased approach and crafting something that is unique.having won the un certain regard prize, i can see why.", "many films about the special relationship between man and his four-legged best friend have been made over the years, and it's a formula that nearly always manages to please. so it is with the latest offering from writer-director guan hu, the story of a former inmate who's been paroled to his hometown on the fringe of the gobi desert in northwestern china after 10 years in prison for a manslaughter conviction, an incident in which he had apparently become unwittingly involved. as he seeks to make amends for his past and start his life over, former motorcycle stunt artist/musician lang yonghui (eddie peng) returns to his roots as china had become engaged in an aggressive, ongoing national program of upgrading its infrastructure in preparation for the 2008 beijing olympics. in this case, this undertaking is a much-needed improvement for a faltering community that has become seriously run down and depopulated. and that exodus, in turn, has created a secondary problem: as many former residents departed, they abandoned their pets (especially dogs), creating a population of strays that has now ballooned to overwhelming proportions. given this preponderance of feral canines - many of whom have become unruly, vicious and a public health risk - local authorities are in desperate need of help in rounding them up. in light of that, as part of lang's government-sanctioned reintegration program, he is assigned to a job in animal control. but, as something of an unassuming soft touch, he struggles to carry out his duties. that becomes particularly true when he's charged with corralling a gaunt, mangy, assertively territorial black dog (xin) suspected of having rabies, a scenario that leads to a decidedly belligerent confrontation between man and beast. however, once the stray is in custody, lang and his captive begin developing an unexpectedly close bond. lang ends up adopting the pooch, and they thus embark on an odyssey of self-discovery for themselves and one another as they work through issues of their own making and the exploration of their newfound relationship. the result is a heartwarming tale filled with genuine affection and loving mutual support, admittedly sometimes a tad obvious in their depiction but undoubtedly always sincere to the core. the narrative truly works best when it focuses on this primary relationship, a story thread that, regrettably, is sometimes intruded upon a little too much by an array of subplots whose variable, sometimes under-explained development and occasionally meandering nature can detract from what works best. nevertheless, these minor distractions aside, \"black dog\" is an otherwise-engaging, enjoyable saga of two outcasts in search of redemption and the wonders that the power of friendship can work for those looking to get their lives back on track. but, then, that's why our four-legged furry companions have deservedly earned their reputation as man's best friends. this winner of the 2024 cannes film festival un certain regard award and independent spirit award nominee for best international film is available for streaming online.", "outstanding drama directed by hu guan from china, so, no wonder it won the top honour in the un certain regard sidebar at cannes for this year.the story revolves around a guy who, following a period of incarceration, comes home and takes a job ridding a town of stray dogs in time for the olympic games. the drama is set on the edge of the gobi desert in northwest china. however, he unexpectedly bonds with a black dog, and the two of them set out on a new adventure.the dog star of the movie took home a

with poetic storytelling, creating an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.the strength of black dog lies in its characters. each one is richly drawn, with motivations and struggles that feel deeply authentic. the protagonist's journey is portrayed with such raw vulnerability that it's impossible not to empathize, even as their decisions veer into morally ambiguous territory. the supporting cast elevates the narrative further, delivering performances that are understated yet profoundly affecting.visually, the film is a masterpiece. the cinematography captures both the starkness and the beauty of the settings, using light and shadow to evoke an atmosphere of tension and melancholy. the use of symbolism is subtle but powerful, adding layers of meaning without feeling forced or pretentious.the pacing is deliberate but never dull, allowing the story to unfold organically. this measured approach heightens the emotional impact, drawing the audience deeper into the characters' world. the soundtrack, too, deserves special mention-it complements the narrative perfectly, blending traditional and modern elements to underscore key moments.at its core, black dog is a meditation on survival and redemption. it challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature while offering a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness."]}

in whole or part many times but no version comes close to the original 1937 screwball comedy starring frederic march and carole lombard. directed by william wellman with a script by ben hecht, nothing sacred is more topical today than it was then. there's been a good deal written on this board about the political incorrectness of it: racism, drunkenness, physical abuse, stereotyping. it's true, there's something to offend everyone. instead of judging everything by today's enlightened standards, i prefer to notice that yes, things were different in the past and then move on to the wonderful, witty script, the very modern topic, the great performances, the early, muted color, lombard's outfits, the old airplane and the scenes of new york as it was in all its glory in the 1930s.march is wally cook, a reporter in hot water for writing about the sultan of brunai who in reality is a regular joe working in new york with a wife who identifies him while he's making pronouncements. wally goes to vermont to hunt down a story about a woman dying of radium poisoning and finds her in the person of hazel flagg (lombard). hazel has just gotten some very bad news from her doctor (charles winninger) - she's not dying. the diagnosis was a mistake. she had hopes of taking a trip out of vermont that was offered to her and asks the doctor to keep the new diagnosis of health quiet. soon after, she meets wally, who wants to bring her to new york for a last fling at the expense of the paper, which will follow her until her last poisoned breath. hazel agrees and takes the doctor with her. at first, she has a blast with only the occasional twinge of guilt. then a german specialist is brought in and blows hazel's scam all to hell.one of the comments had it right - this story predates reality shows by something like 63 years. hazel, like so many today, is an ersatz celebrity, famous for being famous. what will never change is milking a subject for profit until it's dry. nothing sacred has some hilarious scenes and great lines, including the big fight scene in the hotel when wally tries to make hazel seem ill by forcing her to fight with him in order to sweat and raise her pulse rate. the nightclub scene is a riot.lombard is beautiful and wears some stunning outfits and gowns, a gift to hazel from the newspaper. she was a very adept actress with a wonderful sense of comedy. how sad that she is in a film about dying young and would do so five years later at the age of 34. she and march do a great job together - he's normally not known for his comedy but does well here. he approach to wally is serious and he plays wally's intensity and affection for hazel for all it's worth. connelly as his editor is fabulous, as is winninger as the doctor who drinks his way through new york.nothing sacred has been a musical, hazel flagg, and remade as living it up (with jerry lewis as homer flagg). most recently, the general plot was reworked as last holiday. see the original in the screwball comedy genre which is, alas, no more.", "william wellman was really a helluva director. anyone that can do a movie like this, and make \"the ox-bow incident\" too, must have been born to direct.coming in at a breezy 75 minutes, \"nothing sacred\" is still very funny on several levels, for several different reasons. plot does not matter as much as execution, and how you deliver a line matters more than the line itself. frederic march and carole lombard are perfect, and the supporting cast is just as good, especially the actor who played 'oliver stone', march's frustrated boss. wellman does unconventional things like make the actors faces be hidden by a tree branch, practically unheard of in that day and age. but the fact of the matter is, that sometimes people are not perfectly framed in life, so maybe they shouldn't be in the movies - at least not as a rule. the first time you get a good look at lombard, she has shaving cream on her face from kissing a man who is shaving - also not the normal star-moment you might expect. just terrific. 9/10.", "the incandescent carole lombard was simply the most beautiful comedienne during hollywood's golden era of the 1930's. in fact, the one conceit of the film is how her stunning glamour, especially in the newspaper photos, seems at odds with the innocent small-town girl she portrays in this 1937 screwball comedy classic directed in lickety-split fashion by the two-fisted william \"wild bill\" wellman. lombard never let her beauty get in the way of being funny, and her effervescent manner makes her seem dotty enough to make the crazy situations she gets into believable. moreover, the film's constant tweaking at the public obsession over a young woman's impending death predates the concept of reality programming by nearly 70 years.for a movie that clocks in at just 75 minutes, the far-fetched story is fairly dense but clips by without a wasted moment. in brief, wally cook is a new york tabloid reporter relegated to the obituaries after his most recent story is exposed as fake. seeking to rehabilitate his career, he uncovers a story on hazel flagg, a woman in rural vermont dying of radium poisoning. when he arrives in her town, she suddenly learns that her diagnosis was a mistake and that she is not dying at all. however, feeling constrained by her small town existence, hazel pretends to be terminally ill in order to accept wally's offer to take her to new york city. in true 1930's fashion, new york pours its heart out to her making her an instant media celebrity. hazel starts to feel guilty over the misdirected attention, and of course, wally and hazel find themselves falling in love amid all the deception and inevitable chaos.just coming off his classic dramatic turn in the most cohesive version of \"a star is born\", stalwart leading actor fredric march gamely plays the initially cynical wally with the right everyman demeanor, though i kept thinking how much more at home william powell or cary grant would have been in the role. the lovable lombard makes hazel a sublime comic creation even though the character is basically a selfish charlatan. they have a classic sparring scene near the end where each lands a punch on the jaw of the other. familiar character actors complete the cast with walter connolly in constipated frustration as wally's constantly boiling editor-in-chief (aptly named oliver stone), charles winninger properly pixilated as hazel's fraud of a doctor, and familiar faces like sig ruman, margaret hamilton, hattie mcdaniel and hedda hopper in little more than walk-on parts.wellman displays an idiosyncratic way with the camera, for instance, focusing on lombard's ankles as she flirts with march in an open crate or having a tree branch cover their faces during a key dialogue scene. unsurprisingly, the director of \"wings\" and \"lafayette escadrille\" inserted a scene aboard a plane to show off the manhattan skyline. one of the first movies filmed in technicolor, it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age, a constant popping noise exists in the background. not as good as \"my man godfrey\" nor as funny as \"bringing up baby\", \"nothing sacred\" is still great entertainment and a rare opportunity to see the luminous lombard at full star wattage.", "the writers, crew, and cast of \"nothing sacred\" really do treat everything in accordance with the movie's title. no aspect of human society is immune from the sweeping satire. the comedy is fast-paced and often very sharp-edged, and almost any viewer will find it hitting close to home at one time or another, so it is best not to take it too personally. yet this is not a mean-spirited feature, in that it treats everyone the same way, and it shows sympathy even for the very characters whose faults it so ruthlessly exposes.frederic march, as a hardened newsman, and carole lombard, as an appealing woman who is nevertheless living a lie, make a good combination. they are both likable enough to make you care about them even when they are at their most opportunistic. the supporting cast, likewise, features several good performances, with the likes of walter connolly and sig rumann getting some fine moments of their own. william wellman shows a good feel for the material, getting good mileage out of the story without pushing it too far.this kind of feature is somewhat unusual even among movies of its genre. most satires choose their targets, ridicule them, and put the opposing forces in a positive light. but \"nothing sacred\" takes no sides between the small town and the big city, between the powerful and the powerless, or between one character and another. it points out the human flaws to be found in almost all of us.this is the kind of movie that can only be enjoyed if you don't take it personally or too seriously, because in that case the message will be misunderstood. rather than targeting any one kind of person, it intends to make some more general points about human nature that, while sometimes rather pointed, are encased in enough humor to make them palatable.", "absolutely hilarious screwball comedy. a hotshot newspaper reporter(fredric march)tries to get in the good graces of his boss(walter connolly)by exploiting the \"imminent\" death of an ailing young woman(carole lombard). by way of newsprint the doomed young lady becomes the toast of new york city until her health situation is revealed as a hoax. supporting cast includes: frank fay, margaret hamilton and charles winninger. lombard is wonderful in the role of the ailing/doomed hazel flagg from vermont. my favorite scene is when march is walking down the sidewalk and a small boy bolts through a gated fence to bite him on the back of the leg and scurry back to safety. this knee-slapping comedy is directed by william a. wellman and its a crime not to watch.", "i really enjoyed this great 30's screwball comedy which like so many of them hangs on a bizarre plot idea pitting smart man (so he thinks) against smarter woman - guess who always wins in the end. here we get to see the actress with perhaps the best comedic timing of the whole era, carole lombard, in absolutely fizzing form throughout. for these battle of the sexes romps, there has to be a tough-minded, if dim-witted male for the female to run up against and in this occasion the patsy role falls to fredric march, not an actor i'd much associated with comedic parts before but he's great here.previously the sap for the hilarious first scene hoax, march's previously high-ranking features writer finds himself demoted to almost literally the broom cupboard under the stairs with another great hyper-kinetic scene as everybody on the paper almost literally walks all over him while he's trying to write his copy.to redeem himself in his testy editor's eye, he espies a potential feel-good story of a small-town girl's supposedly terminal illness and whisks her off to new york for a heart-tugging human interest tale of the innocent abroad seeing the sights and sounds of new york before she expires. the only problem is, her country bumpkin doctor has got his diagnosis wrong and there's nothing at all wrong with her. so what do you want the girl to do? well, dragging along her usually inebriated doc for the ride, she more than happily takes up march on his offer, becoming a household celebrity in the big apple long before the accursed words \"reality star\" ever entered the language.of course it all ends in tears of sadness, rage and joy, pretty much in that order, with lots of laughs along the way. the most famous scene i guess, is when lombard's hazel flagg character is presented to the great and good in new york society at a posh dinner and when asked for a few words, can only burp a reply before falling down dead drunk. i laughed at that but i also laughed at a great little sight gag when big bad city news-man march gets bitten on the leg by a rabid infant when he arrives in the backwater looking for his quarry. i also loved writer ben hecht's topical jokes about the presidents of the day - wouldn't he have a field day right now!there are a couple of jarring moments however which at least remind us how society has progressed in the years ahead, like when the drunken doctor casually sings the racially offensive \"d\" word or when march actually socks lombard on the jaw, but at least she gives it straight back to him.on the whole, this is a great, breakneck comedy, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind and as a bonus it's in an early colour print process with some great shots of 30's new york in its pomp.", "some of the recent comments are wholly unjust to this movie. the point of the film is to make fun of phony sentimentalism, sanctimonious posturing, and the general tendency of the media to put profit ahead of grace, dignity, and the simple truth. carole lombard is not only beautiful, but an exceedingly talented actress (in this and everything else she did). the writing cuts to the bone, exposing hypocrisy in all its forms. the film is as fresh today, and is as relevant to the culture, as it was when it was made. as for the notion that a movie made in 1937 offends someone's sense of what is politically correct in 2004, and therefore deserves criticism, give me a break.", "just saw this \"classic\" on amc and even though it's very hard to make me laugh, there are 2 extremely funny lines (won't spoil them for you) regarding things that are written in letters penned by the carole lombard character. i laughed out loud. after the movie was over i was still \"playing\" these lines in my head and laughing.that kind of humor is rare for a movie that's 60 years old-- i haven't seen/heard these jokes duplicated in a movie since.definitely worth seeing. 7 out of 10.", "the team of david o. selznick producer, william wellman director, and fredric march leading man, after having had a big hit the year before with a star is born, teamed up again to create one of the great screwball comedies of the thirties in nothing sacred. the inspiration for this film comes from the fertile imagination of ben hecht best known previously for co-authoring another newspaper classic, the front page. hecht takes it a step further and while the morning post reports the news faster and better than its rivals, it doesn't create the news. here the media is satirized for creating a celebrity.poor carole lombard as hazel flagg, country girl from rural vermont who is misdiagnosed by her country doctor charles winninger as having incurable radiation poisoning. it's a small news item over the wire services.but when hotshot reporter fredric march gets a hold of it, he convinces his editor walter connolly to build up the story by bringing lombard to new york and ballyhooing her into celebrity status. lombard and winninger by now know an error in diagnosis was made, but who can turn down an all expense paid trip to new york? the story just mushrooms until it gets away from any kind of control.the difference sometimes between comedy and drama is often so slight as to be imperceptible. there's not much difference between fredric march's character in nothing sacred and kirk douglas's in ace in the hole. both are down on their luck newspaper people looking for a comeback and both exploit a story to their own ends, march comically and douglas tragically. but the plots are more similar than one realizes.even today we still hunger for our celebrities some of whom are nothing but professional celebrities. the sad life of anna nicole smith is proof of that.when you think about anna nicole smith though nothing sacred appears dated it actually has a very timeless message about the power of media to create and destroy.", "a very witty comedy based in new york and the life of a reporter who seems to be coming up short. he can only get the job of writing obituaries in the paper and he is contanstantly trying to get back on his editors good side.it is a very good screwball comedy with romance as well as very good comedy through witty lines and funny actions by the characters.there's is a bit of a twist in the story when the main character realizes what is really going on but has to make a choice due to the fact he has fallen for the girl who is supposed to be his story.the musical part by oscar levant both mocks and celebrates the musical style that was being used during that time period.it is also possible to view in color because it was shot in technicolor so you can see what new york looked like back in the 30's which is pretty interesting.", "a southern hick, i love it when vermonters are made fun of. of course, they are only one of the many groups this movie pokes fun at. if you don't want to see physical abuse made funny, don't see this hilarious satire on everything politically correct. of course, what really makes this hilarious is that in 1937, they didn't know it was politically incorrect to show man hitting women, to show 'darkies', irascible and rude new englanders, etc. then there's the propeller-driven airplanes, the first of the airliners flying right past the head of the statue of liberty. and guess what? jack welch's fortress, rockefeller center, looked then just like it looks now. some things don't change: newspaper chicanery, among others. the hoaxes they bring about, and the hoaxes they continue to abet all in the name of news, is not news anymore.....it's sop. right now, the current hoax is the nomenclature used to describe the appointing of the cabinet, as though the election were a fait accomplis: \"andrew card, the president's new appointee......\" and other such insiduously assumptive language has been used before, as this movie wonderfully points out. in this case, it's a woman at death's door dying of radium poisoning.....who ain't!!! i'm giving nothing away, it's perfectly obvious from the beginning. i suppose i should rail against the prejudice shown against all newspaper folks by the good people of vermont, as they shut this guy out....with one toddler biting him on the leg as he walks down the street....but it just felt too good. (after all, some really do take their jobs as members of the 4th estate and protectors of the common good seriously.)the color is pretty good for 1937, and you'll see the wicked witch of the east portraying her less wicked, but still spiteful self. what will give you chills is the pervading knowledge as you hear carole lombard's dialogue about death and dying...that she wasn't to ever grow old gracefully, but died in a plane crash not long after this film was made. she was a beautiful woman, and did quiet a good job of acting in this many-faceted satire of life and our attraction to dying, or the pretense of it.well worth your time on many levels ...just to see film-making of the 30's and how good it could be, for one.", "only david o. selznick could get away with making a thoroughly mean-spirited raspberry to media manipulation during the production code's early vigorous enforcement. this is hopefully the only screwball comedy where our leading man knocks out our leading woman on the jaw in order to silence her for medical professionals. don't worry too much though, since our leading lady is carole lombard, she makes sure that her co-star, frederic march, gets his jaw socked as well.for anyone who thinks that preston sturges and billy wilder were the first ones to tackle acidic comedies, i gleefully point them to this film where there's not one single likable person to be found in the admittedly impressive cast. at some point, you'd wish that all of them would get radium poisoning and die violently for your amusement. even carole lombard has her moments where she's an awful, terrible person. she only goes along with her faux-poisoning in order to see new york, as well as to get out of her spiteful small town.its main theme on the timeless tradition of rotten media exploiting tragedies for national relevance is so cynical in execution that it makes ace in the hole briefly look like andy hardy. sadly, it's still relevant as our media is so captivated with sensationalism that we have breaking tragedies occur without any real change resulting from them.naturally, i'm expected to hate this one instead of sympathizing with it - i'm definitely not a fan of being-cynical-for-the-sake-of-being-cynical. this film is admittedly guilty of not deciding what tone it needs to focus on, which makes it even more malicious in its rebelliousness. it's also guilty of not having hindsight in joke material, as it features a lot of anti-humor in the disguise of punchlines.however, the frankly smug film is smarter than its purposefully immature characters. deep down, it knows that everyone is a rotten, terrible monster who really don't deserve their privilege. this is what makes it so uncomfortably fresh - it refuses to gloss over its worldview and instead shows it in all its ugly shades. unlike most of the glitzy fluff that hollywood cranked out at the time, this film is still razor sharp all these decades later.moreover, carole lombard and frederic march are perfectly cast as the only remotely likable characters; you really do get terrific chemistry between them to the point you sort of forgive them for hitting each other. plus, it's the rare classic hollywood film where you get to see someone actually giving the screen an unusual gesture. again, selznick was really persuasive with the censors.", "nothing sacred is another screwball comedy that fits the bill with the rest of the films during that time. carole lombard, after playing irene bullock in the ultra successful my man godfrey film a year earlier, once again is brilliant as she plays hazel flaggs. the film is able to present comedy through excellent execution of the dialogue and creative script writing from the filmmakers. the movie is very well directed by william wellman and is truly successful in getting humor out of the eccentric characters and the overall feel in the film. the acting in the movie is superb with each joke or line being delivered perfectly in order to make the film funny and light-hearted. nothing sacred combined terrific script writing with tremendous acting to become a classic movie from a time when movies were forced to follow the strict guidelines of the 1934 censorship code.", "guess i won't be going to warsaw, vermont, anytime soon. they speak only two abrupt words there and everyone except lombard looks like the wicked witch of the east. no wonder lombard wants to get the heck out even if she has to pretend to be dying to do it.the selznick production's a first-rate effort all the way around, from colorful sets to snappy direction to vibrant acting. the premise is a tricky one- deceiving popular emotions by faking death, but the selznick crew brings it off in astute madcap fashion. it's the kind of material that could go badly wrong without sure hands to guide it.lombard calibrates nicely in the central role, while the boisterous connoly almost steals the show with a flashy performance. in fact, his newspaper editor is assertive enough to rescue general custer. on the other hand, reporter march has to low-key it as lombard's sensible advisor. and did i imagine it or does lombard, wittingly or not, flash a bandaged middle-finger salute during the dance numbers. also, ns is apparently (imdb) the first comedy to be filmed in color, the process then being only a year or so old, but you'd never know it from the print i saw.anyway, seldom does hollywood combine disparate elements as slickly as here, even when some story elements are touchy. all in all, i would think the wellman helmed flick amounts to one of the radiant lombard's best.", "carole lombard is the scatterbrained redhead from rural vermont who fakes a terminal disease in order to enjoy an all-expenses-paid final fling in new york city, which she says she \"couldn't appreciate\" during her only other visit (at age three). discovered by hard-luck reporter frederick march and sponsored by his headline-hungry newspaper, she becomes an instant human-interest sensation: the doomed but noble innocent on whom the public can lavish all its bogus sympathies. the film may be less madcap than other screwball comedies of the time, but writer ben hecht's clearheaded satire of big city (and small town) hypocrisies still provides plenty of laughs, and the restored technicolor print (i saw this on the big screen in the mid-1980s) is a real treat.", "a cute show. nothing made me roll on the floor, but still cute. carole lombard was soooo beautiful. and she was secure enough in it to take a comedic role where she would make faces, and have her hair wet, and other things that many beautiful actresses would not. i recommend.", "the votes for this movie must have been based on political correctness, for based on hilarity, assuming one has a healthy sense of the absurd, this film rates a solid 10.true, those who are thin-skinned will find the racial and gender and, uh, regional send-offs deplorable. however, since the film is a brilliant satire on the phoniness of those who take themselves too seriously, it is natural that when these people see themselves in it, they will be offended.\"nothing sacred\" refers not only to the values hypocrisy seeks to destroy, but to the sacred cows the film seeks to topple. carol lombard has never been lovelier or more picaresque, and frederic march plays a great foil for the barely plausible goings on.one of the irritants in the highly regarded \"bringing up baby\" is the completely implausible haplessness of cary grant's character and the determined obtuseness of kathrine hepburn's. in \"nothing sacred\" there are no such distractions; it is the superior film.other joys of the film are the delightful vignettes, such as a dipsomaniacal country doctor's tirade against journalists (in vino veritas, indeed!) and the transparently phony patriotism at a strip club.filmed in glorious early technicolor.", "before watching this movie, i looked up the trailer on youtube and it seemed like it was going to be pretty funny. i also wanted to see it because it was in technicolor, the first one for my film class so far. it was amusing at times, but i was kind of disappointed. after watching \"my man godfrey\", this paled in comparison. the main guy seemed to be a pretty shallow character. i felt bad for him at first, but then he just kind of seemed like a gullible idiot. the dialog wasn't as funny, the characters weren't lovable. i don't remember any of their names. the storyline was actually kind of boring to me, i found myself checking my phone during it. the only thing that excited me was seeing margaret hamilton (of \"wizard of oz\" fame).", "it's nice to see frederic march and carole lombard in color, especially since this was the only color film she ever made. the premise is pretty silly, that so much would be made out of this 'dying' woman in the press and all over new york that shows would be stopped in her presence, she would be given the key to the city, etc., but it's a screwball comedy, so you just have to roll with it. the film had its moments, such as the treatment march faces in vermont, with its taciturn adults, and a child who scampers out from behind a fence to bite him on the leg. however, it's pretty uneven in terms of humor, with a lot of run of the mill content, and several groaners. you'll also have to forgive some racial stereotypes, and march working lombard up into a fever by boxing with her, and then knocking her out in one of the film's big scenes. those bits are in keeping with the time period and not too ugly though, and it was nice to see lombard give as good as she got. the production value for the film was high, as despite the weakness of the early technicolor process, it had a nice score, and many fantastic shots around new york.my favorite moment in the film is when march proposes to lombard, despite thinking she has only a few weeks to live. in a film with a lot of screwball moments and one-liners, it had this little gem: \"oh wally, i... i mustn't. don't ask me. please, just kiss me once more and let it go at that without ruining your life.\" \"so what the devil is there better to life than we've got? a handful of perfect hours. that's all the luckiest ever get out of it. just a handful of hours to save and remember. and then... i'll be there at the end, sailor. i'll be there waving you goodbye. it'll be the same as if you and i had lived forever. and you'll... you'll grow old in my heart.\"", "what makes this something special is the technicolor. to see a 1930s film, 1930s actors and 1930s new york in proper colour is fantastic. the film is pretty good too.being the first three-strip technicolor comedy makes it stand out from the crowd and like say 1928's broadway melody, the first proper sound picture, this film attracts a greater amount of criticism than it would have done were it made in black and white. in some ways, because it now looks like a modern film, its judged against modern standards but it's not, it's a 1930s film, in fact a very typical 1930s film - and made just a decade after they figured out how to make pictures talk. this has got all the classic must-haves of an 1930s talking picture: a sassy and sexy dame, a fast talking smart guy hero, a pompous sap of a boss along with some vicious, dark almost pre-code humour (in fact this does have a pre-code feel about it). if you like the films from the 1930s, for example topper which was made this same year, you will like this one - it's got a similar kind of gentle humour. with a script from ben hecht, you know you're going to be entertained, and you're not disappointed with this.because this is relatively well-known, a lot of people have spent too much time over-thinking what it all means. personally i just thought it was a funny comedy with three fabulous and thoroughly engaging actors: march, lombard and connolly but if i wanted to be critical i can see why some people think that ben hecht could have done a bit better. one issue is: if hecht is highlighting the hypocrisy of his old profession, the newspaper business, why does the theme of this seem to suggest that deception in some cases is a good thing? maybe there are layers of irony hidden behind those newspaper sheets of cynicism or maybe it's just what made mr hecht laugh when he was writing it? there's far too much selfishness, emotion, deception, regret and ambition going on in this to figure it all out and what would be the point anyway - the characters are believable enough for you to like them and it's funny - that's all that matters. if you do want something much more biting and judgmental about newspaper men there's the very non-funny but jaw-droppingly emotive five star final from 1931 with edward g robinson. watch that and you'll be campaigning to have all journalists sent down the river immediately. watch this however and you'll be smiling.", "this ¨nothing sacred¨ classy film was competently directed by william wellman , was written by ben hecht , who also wrote the book for hazel flagg and receives onscreen credit for the subsequent remake titled :

fredric march finds out about this and brings lombard and winninger to new york as a publicity stunt . here carole lombard gives a very sympathetic acting as the woman who meets a reporter looking for a story, she feigns sickness again for her own profit. in fact , carole lombard told that this was one of her favorites of the films she made. fredric march is equally excellent as the obstinate journalist who discovers that lombard is not going to die, but this does not matter to him ; he has fallen in love with her . the fabulous main cast is well accompanied by a pretty good support cast ,

up, as cook is relegated to the paper's obituary section of a report by way of punishment for his story about the sultan. he sees his chance to revive his career when he spots a news piece about a young woman from a small vermont town who is doomed to die from radium poisoning – and suggests to the editor that it would be a great story to bring her to new york to see all the sights and enjoy herself while she still can. the editor reluctantly agrees, and wally heads off to rural vermont. the funniest scenes in the whole film, for my money, are those when he arrives in hazel's town and everyone in sight treats him with suspicion and when the small boy dashes out through a gate to bite him in the leg! this title had me laughing throughout the whole movie.", "i wouldn't call this a screwball comedy, though. it stars out with fredric march as a reporter who is demoted because his last story was a fake. he convinces his boss, played by walter connolly who always seems to play these kind of roles, to make a bigger story out of a woman dying of radium poisoning. he takes her to new york and show her a good time until she dies. but it turns out she isn't dying and she wants to tell march but her doctor won't let her or something like that. this movie is pretty short at only 75 minutes and it could of been longer. fredric march is great as the reporter and carole lombard is also good as the woman who is faking her illness. this movie was directed by william a. wellman who didn't too many comedies.", "in a screwball comedy, the dialogue should be sharp, witty, and come fast and furious.\"nothing sacred\" has a few flashes of true humor delivered by carole lombard, but is an otherwise plodding, dull, and pedestrian comedy.", "a newspaper does a series of stories on a dying young woman, turning her into a celebrity, but the problem is she's not dying. this breezy comedy is enhanced by the presence of the incomparable lombard, one of the greatest comediennes to come out of hollywood. although mainly known for his dramatic roles, march was quite capable of doing comedy, as he shows here. the two stars work well together in this enjoyable farce. wellman also was not known for comedies, but he directs with a light touch here. the only quibble is that this ends somewhat abruptly. this is an early technicolor film, although there apparently are not any good surviving prints.", "it's not often that a film is able to pull off punching a woman right in the face as fodder for comedy, but it was the 30's, and domestic abuse was funny back then. no points are deducted here for poor taste, mainly because carole lombard got her retribution in satisfying manner. 1937's screwball comedy, nothing sacred does nothing special. it's a short film clocking in at less than 80 minutes; wasting no time to throw down 'the end' once the conclusion was declared. only ten years had passed since the first 'talkie' in 1927, yet nothing sacred unlike many others during this period has aged quite well in comparison. rarely while watching this film, would anyone be detracted by any technological restrictions, this inaugural screwball filmed in color has been restored to levels that allow it to look marvelous, even by today's standards.this is not a film i would go out of my way to watch again, but when taking the time to consider where film was at in 1937, it's easy to be impressed with how enjoyable of a film this was. to provide some context, actress margaret hamilton has a bit part early in the movie as \"the drug store lady.\" you might better know her as the \"wicked witch of the west,\" a role she's iconically play two years later.overall, nothing sacred does stand on it's own. it tackles an important topic in journalistic ethics along with presenting it in absorbable medium. the acting is solid and the chemistry between the two leads is strong. this is the type of a film that lays a strong groundwork for future classics though can stand on its own without excuses. there is much to like here for film lovers who have a soft spot for these 30s-40's romantic comedies.", "nothing sacred is a screwball comedy which is rather light on the laughs. carole lombard is unsurprisingly the best thing the film has to offer. she has great comedic talent and genuine star power. but a performer is only as good as the material and unfortunately for lombard, and for the viewer, the material here just isn't good enough. the movie is rather dull and, despite clocking in at a mere 77 minutes long, plodding. lombard has her moments and injects a little life into the proceedings now and again. but by and large the film falls flat. it's not very interesting and, fatally for a comedy, not very funny.lombard plays hazel flagg, a young vermont woman who is dying of radium poisoning. only she is not actually dying, she was misdiagnosed and is actually in perfectly fine health. she finds this out just before disgraced new york newspaperman wally cook tracks her down. wally needs a big story to rescue his career after his last big story turned out to be a total fraud. hazel flagg, the courageous young woman bravely facing death. that will be his big story. hazel isn't going to tell him she's not actually dying because, hey, he offered her a trip to new york! the whole city falls in love with brave, valiant hazel flagg. how long can this charade be kept up? meanwhile, hazel and wally might be falling in love. this whole thing is a big mess which seems destined to unravel in spectacular fashion. it's a scenario which seems to have much comedic potential. but the laughs never come. lombard has her charms and gives it a game effort. but she has so little to work with. and her co-stars don't provide much in the way of help. fredric march displays very little personality in the role of wally, the character comes across as very dry. walter connolly, playing wally's boss, is a notable supporting player. unfortunately he's notable really only for how annoying he is. horribly grating overacting. ultimately nothing sacred proves to be nothing special. this is a dud.", "nothing sacred is a satire comedy that mostly focuses on death. it is witty, cynical, a bit race but really and entertaining, part of the screwball comedy genre. carol lombard is the lead in the film, and she give a great performance. she is stunning and funny through out. i found this film to be on par with my man godfrey, but i did not enjoy it as much. in order to get some of the jokes you have to put yourself in a 30's mindset, but the film is funny no matter. the plot is a bit far fetched but its the acting that keeps it all together. i had a great time watching this film and recommend it to anyone interested in a good laugh.", "oh my my was this ahead of it's time or what! the funniest thing out of the 30's that you've never heard of. super quick, non-chalant humor that's indifferent to weather or not you laugh and that makes it so funny (does not force one joke on it's audience and the effect is so humbling that it solidifies the humor.) plus a lot of improving from a greatly skilled cast. i do mean great, they were all completely on top of their roles.i was surprised to see such a sharp funny movie from this era, i mean in the type of funny it is. chock full o gags and easy to watch the whole way through, i don't think there was one thing wrong with this one.", "\"this is new york skyscraper champion of the world where the slickers and know-it-alls peddle hold bricks to each other...and where truth, crushed to earth, rises again more phony than a glass eye.\"this is a selznick-wellman pairing that brings us a story of fake news and sensational journalism. the morning star newspaper gets caught in a big fake news scandal involving a show shine man that they were touting as a wealthy sultan. the reporter responsible, cook, gets demoted to obituaries but talks his way into doing a sensational story about a poor vermont girl who is dying of radium poisoning...except she just found out she is not. when our reporter cook arrives in the vermont town he discovers it's a company town owned by the watch making company...so no one's talking. the company was to give hazel, that's our dying girl, $200 and she was going to take a trip. the newspaper man, still thinking she's dying, offers to take her to new

frederick march and gene kelly...really remind me of each other.)", "carole lombard was 29 when she made this movie. she had been in nearly 70 movies by this time, starring in about 40 of them. she had been famous for ten years. frederick march was 40 years and had been starring in movies for 8 years. he was starring in his 37th film. thus we have two top stars, totally professional at this point, yet still young. they're at the top of their game and are a joy to watch. i'm afraid that i have only seen two other carole lombard movies, \"my man godfrey,\" and \"made for each other.\" neither of these impressed me. however, this movie did impress me. she is hitting each emotional note perfectly without straining or overacting in any scene. frederick march stands with bogart, muni, cagney, gable, grant and tracy as one of the top actors of the 1930's. he's on auto-pilot here, but the material is so good that he doesn't really have to inject more than his natural (for the time) acting style. for me, this film ranks with \"his girl friday\" and \"it happened one night\" as one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's. william wellman, the director, is as good as they come. he has a great visual sense and knows when to let scenes play out without making too many cuts. in the straight jacket of the hays moral code after 1934, it was difficult to show people acting immorally and having fun without creating a sense of guilt. somehow, the writer ben hecht was able to come right up to the wire and sometimes even jump over. this movie is still more outrageous than most of the outrageous comedies of the last 20 years.", "classic cynical ben hecht material tries to mine laughs from unusually grim material. i'm not offended; to be so brazen reflects a fairly modern sensibility, but the treatment is everything. here the setup is really dull. as written hazel is unconscionable and lombard doesn't do anything to make her less cardboard. the first hour is riddled with run-of-the-mill developments, stock, un-nuanced thirties \"types\" (streetwise journalist, exasperated newspaper boss, daffy girl) and too many whiny lombard moments. i started to wonder if she really was talented. i was really not enjoying this.but i was surprised that after such an unpromising start, the last 20 minutes of this are so much better. lombard regains herself and gets some good laughs, often from completely unremarkable lines. small sidebits (max!) are funny. the bedroom argument/punching match is good. one of the better swipes is that although new yorkers are described as jaded, the heartland types shown are actually much more calculating and unethical. some great hecht lines: \"i can hit her, i love her.\" \"funeral over, a great success.\"on the minus side, this is full of unkind racial stereotypes (black, dutch, native american, polish).this dvd is now available for a dollar (!) from movie classics. the new low-end market has some quirks: the dvd has no menu page. the movie is just one long chapter, and although it purports to be digitally remastered, the granularity, focus and audio are tragic. eh, what do you want for a buck?", "at a mere 77 minutes, this delicious serving of pure hilarious cynicism still seems a bit long while you're watching it -- maybe because the writers at times invest too much in milking all they can from certain scenes. but when this satire rolls, it really rocks. too, too bad that so many film makers of today lack both the insight and the skill to produce a match for this old chestnut. carol lombard gives her usually fine performance playing a character who gets too deep into her once-innocent scheme to back out gracefully. she does some over playing here, but isn't that the way lucille ball played lucy for so many years? frederick march turns in one of his best performances, walter connolly and most of the others are right on-key. you can add this to w. wellman's long list of very professional directing gigs. and warn everyone -- this is one movie you don't walk into in the middle!", "this was indeed a hilarious movie, and reminded me (because i saw it first) of the movie with queen latifah

actors lombard and march portraying a really great pair, the movie went along smoothly with some really funny jokes. the comedy with such a sort of tragic (for those in the movie who didn't know she

this movie, and the way the beautiful lombard seemed to let it flow from every aspect of herself. the viewer was completely captivated with her, and her little deceit. it's the kind of story, were you know what's going to happen, but still there's never a dull moment. the whole 75 minutes of the film is backed full of pure laugh out loud entertainment. and the best part of it is that those living outside of the cities today can empathize with hazel flagg's actions. she is not the lying villain, but the naïve, guilt ridden heroine. the imagery of ny was major bonus for this movie and in selling it to audiences. especially the shot of the manhattan skyline seen from the plane.", "lombard discovers she isn't dying but keeps up the pretence to win a trip to new york. frederick march is the journalist covering the story for her last few weeks and inevitably falls in love with her. problems arrive as she gains the love, respect and sympathy of all nw york.very witty mixture of black and screwball comedy with both leads on top form, although lombard gets most of the laughs. the supporting cast, particularly charles winninger as her drunken doctor who knows the truth and paper editor walter connolly are terrific. the dialogue seems so modern and sharp and often very dark indeed - 'tell me doctor how is she, don't spare my feelings, we go to press in 15 minutes' - glorious stuff.it

course demands it, and i won't give a thing away.there is some spectacle built into the production, which doesn't help the movie, but overall it has that famous 1930s ridiculous style that is fast and nonsensical in turns. lombard is at her best, really, and if you like frederick march, they do seem a good match (he doesn't have much life on screen for me). acting aside, it's the plot, as laid out so smartly by ben hecht, that builds and compounds as it goes, and it's a total riot.", "i was promised a classic screwball comedy, so i was very disappointed with what i got.\"nothing sacred\" has a very short running time (73 minutes) and still managed to drag. carole lombard can be delightful to watch, but her manic performance in this stretches for laughs that just aren't there. fredric march is actually funnier, because he's so much more droll. william a. wellman, who directed, does do some interesting things (like film a two-shot of march and lombard with their faces hidden behind a tree branch), but the film doesn't have the snap and pop of films that earn their screwball classic status (like \"bringing up baby\" for instance).there is one very funny scene in \"nothing sacred,\" when march is trying to get lombard hot and worked up so that they can convince people she's dying of fever and decides the best way to do it is to fight each other. if the whole film had been like that scene, my review would be quite different.grade: b-", "enjoy many of william a wellman's direction of films and in this film he goes completely slapstick with his leading stars being carole lombard as hazel flagg and fredric march as wally cook. janet gaynor was originally selected for the role as hazel flagg and was decided that carole lombard was best suited for the role and she was a great success. this is a story about hazel flagg who lives in a town called warsaw, vermont and hazel has been advised by her physician in town that she has a very short time to live, because she has a radiation in her system and it will take her life. a new york city newspaper man picks up on her story and decides to visit her town and write a complete story about her condition and her life. this report is wally cook, (fredric march) who visits this town and gets a very cold reception from everyone in town and especially margaret hamilton, (warsaw, vermont drug store lady) who two year later appeared in \"the wizard of oz\" in 1939. there is lots of comedy and carole lombard the wife of clark gable gave a great performance with lots of vitality and humor. enjoy.", "first, a little background, this taken from information on wikipedia: technicolor was perfected by 1935. selznick int'l was formed in the same year with the intention of producing a limited number of films yearly, of the highest quality, all to be filmed in technicolor.if you look at the garden of allah, released in 1936, one year prior to nothing sacred, there is a film credit of \"filmed in technicolor\" below the title. there is also a separate credit for natalie kalmus as technicolor supervisor.however, the notation below nothing sacred's title, only says \"in color\" and there is no technicolor credit of any kind in the credits. had it been filmed in technicolor, there would definitely have been a technicolor credit, since the only way to film in technicolor, was to rent the cameras from the technicolor corporation. there were competing color processes around so who knows why selznick deviated from its policy.it's probably not cinecolor. according to the information on wikipedia, cinecolor wasn't used for anything other than animation in the time period nothing sacred was produced.i viewed a dvd borrowed from the library, which said \"digitally remastered\" on the jacket. what a joke! it was the worst quality print imaginable--faded color and scratches galore.this lack of quality is likely from the copyright holder's failure to renew the copyright, putting the film in the public domain, and anybody could make a dvd copy. according to wikipedia, disney has the original negatives. the university of texas, austin, has all of selznick international's papers, so perhaps someone there could see whether there are surviving production notes about what color process was used to produce this film.i give the film a 7 for content and performance, but i wonder if there exists a decent dvd copy around for us to view.", "in this 1937 film a reporter is assigned to find a young woman who is supposedly very ill. he travels to find her and to bring her to ny city. she then goes to events to celebrate her life before she dies from the poisoning . the character development was interesting in this movie there were three main characters hazel flagg wally cook and dr enoch downer. they basically lie to everyone and say that she is very sick. i thought that the cinematography has improved since the first silent films came out. for example this film was shot in color which was another thing that i appreciated. this movie was hard to follow the plot did not make sense to me. i did how ever like the chemistry between the actors that is the sign for good acting with out that you can not have a decent film.", "after watching nothing sacred, i found it to be quite boring after watching 20 minutes. i couldn't really catch on to it and like it. a few camera shots i really like, like when hazel and wally are in the box and wally asks hazel to marry him, i really like the tracking/ push in shot. i also found the establishing shots to be very nice also. carole lombard was great in my man godfrey and she's very good in this film as well. it seems like she plays the character of an over dramatic young female very well. i also found the actor who played the doctor and wally quite good as well. the plot was kind of clouded for me i couldn't really understand it all too well. you could easily see the screwball comedy aspects in the film though. they stood out quite well.", "for a comedy, i didn't find it very funny. the manipulation and caught-in-the-lie plot is just bland. i was never a fan of that kind of movie (though there are exceptions), and just seeing the characters trip over themselves coming up with the right stories to fool people was just painful. it had some good acting, and the dialogue is great, but it reminds me of every other movie that came after it.i did enjoy the interactions between wally and hazel, particularly at the end. it would have been nice to see their relationship evolve as hazel is fooling everyone, but for what it was i thought it was okay. the last 10 minutes of their characters are some of the highlights for obvious reasons.also, while this isn't the point of the movie, i was not a big fan of the cultural appropriation in this. that show hazel had to attend to where women ride horses on stage was awful; pocahontas and the indian portrayal made me cringe, especially when she yelled and smacked her mouth with her hand. ugh! i'm thankful i don't see this crap today. i know this was the late 30's and no one cared back then, but to put something like that in a comedy is terrible.anyway. now that i got that out of my system, i'll at least comment on the cinematography. it was quite pretty, and the color is lovely. i especially love some of the camera work, especially when stone and wally were talking back and forth, where they have to lean forward a bit to talk to each other since the flowers were in the way of their line of sight; very interesting point of view there, though i don't know why they used it. i also really liked how blue the colors were while wally and hazel were at the river (spoilers); the camera slowly drifts from the back of the duct all the way to the front where we could see their shadowed faces. an interesting transition without cutting from shot to shot.in general, this movie was so-so, but it's not my favorite. i wish it was funnier, hence its genre. maybe i'm missing something, but from my perspective it could have been executed a lot better.", "it was remade as a vehicle for martin & lewis and turned into a broadway musical but william wellman's original was a gold-plated joy from start to finish. i suppose you could call \"nothing sacred\" a satire on sensationalism in the newspaper business or maybe just one of the funniest movies ever made, (the writer was ben hecht working at the top of his game). it's the one about the girl dying of radium poisioning who then discovers she isn't but keeps the pretence up anyway, (yes, it's a comedy perhaps not in the best of taste), and it has great performances from carole lombard, fredric march, charles winninger and walter connolly, magnificent as the gruff editor of the newspaper march works for. indeed the only fault i can find with the film is the decision to shoot it in colour, however pretty it might look.", "this film essentially begins with a reporter for the new york newspaper \"the morning star\" essentially being disgraced for promoting a story that turned out to be completely bogus. to get back into good graces with his boss the reporter, \"wally cook\" (frederic cook) convinces him that a recent report of a young woman named \"hazel flagg\" (carole lombard) gracefully dying of radium poison in a small town in vermont is worth national attention. so he is allowed to go there to check it out. sure enough, hazel was indeed diagnosed with radium poisoning and given only a short time to live, however, the physician who made this diagnosis \"dr. enoch downer\" (charles winninger) has recently found out he was wrong. yet rather than admitting his mistake the only person he tells is hazel-who sees an opportunity to get out of her small town and travel to new york by pretending otherwise. what she doesn't realize is that wally has staked what's left of his reputation on her and the more she tries to cover up the truth the worse things get for everyone concerned. now rather than reveal any more i will just say that this was a light and breezy comedy which manages to pass the time quite well and for that reason i have rated it accordingly. slightly above average.", "nothing sacred (selznick international/united artists, 1937), directed by william a. wellman, stars carole lombard in one of her finer comedies. unlike any of her other screen efforts, this movie is notable for being her only one done entirely in technicolor. produced under david o. selznick, whose earlier works of the garden of allah (1936) and a star is born (1937) were also lenced in technicolor, it's a wonder why his swashbuckling adventure of the prisoner of zenda (1937), wasn't produced in the same manner while products as nothing sacred could have gone just as well in black and white format. regardless, nothing sacred provided lombard her only opportunity in a technicolor feature, which benefits this production all the more. cast opposite fredric march for the second and final time, following their initial pairing in the war aviation drama, the eagle and the hawk (paramount, 1933), nothing sacred also shows how much better they work together in comedy as opposed to melodrama.opening title (over the visual of rockefeller center and other new york city landmarks): \"this is new york, skyscraper champion of the world ... where the slickers and know-it-all peddle gold bricks to each other ... and where truth crushed together rises again are more phony than a glass eye.\" wally cook (fredric march), star reporter for the morning star newspaper, along with oliver stone (walter connolly), his publisher, are holding a banquet for an important guest of honor, prince surta (troy brown), who is immediately exposed by his wife (hattie mcdaniel) as ernest walker, a shoeshine man in harlem. because of the humiliation, and unable to fire wally due to his five year contract, oliver reduces his star reporter to obituary editor with his desk placed inside a small filing room. not wanting to spend those remaining years at his present position, wally talks oliver into sending him on an assignment in warsaw, vermont, to interview a young girl named hazel flagg, a victim of radium poisoning with only six months to live. believing this would boost circulation, wally is given that assignment. before his arrival to warsaw, hazel (carole lombard, appearing 16 minutes into the start of the story), learns from her physician, doctor enoch downer (charles winninger) that her medical report regarding her poisoning was a mistake and that she will live after all. initially planning to enjoy life to the fullest before she dies, she chooses new york city as her destination. it so happens that wally, after meeting with hazel invites her to a holiday in new york as guest of the morning star with all expenses paid, and a day-by-day exclusive up to the time she dies. hazel accepts the offer, taking the doctor with her. seeing the sites as madison square garden and other landmarks, she also becomes a guest of honor at the casino moderne. gathering all this attention from media and public alike, hazel begins to feel guilty being a fraud, and wants to release herself from this situation without being exposed nor hurting wally's reputation with the newspaper.other members of the cast include such fine reliable character actors as sig rumann (doctor emile egglehoffer); margaret hamilton (the drug store lady); john qualen (the fireman); maxie rosembloom (the prizefighter), with hedda hopper, olin howland, and george chandler in smaller but notable parts. comedian frank fay plays a master of ceremonies for the casino moderne sequence. monty woolley can be spotted as one of the doctors out to examine haze; while billy barty gets a cameo bit as a child who bites wally's leg.an amusing story with notable scenes such as the opening banquet that sets the tone of the story, along with the introduction to the residents of vermont where they all respond with one word answers, as well as lombard contemplating a staged suicide. walter connolly is typical and very amusing as the harassed publisher while charles winninger shows he could play something other than aging performer who believes vaudeville will never die. great scenes of new york city in technicolor process are also an added plus. the screenplay by ben hecht with story by james h, street was later revamped by paramount titled living it up (1954) with the comedy team of dean martin and jerry lewis in the march and lombard roles.falling into public domain, nothing sacred was not only distributed to video cassette by numerous distribution companies in the early 1980s, but was overplayed on various television and public tv channels for several years. currently on dvd, nothing sacred also had exposure on cable channels over the years, notably american movie classics(prior to 2001) and turner classic movies. while there are better carole lombard comedies worth noting, nothing sacred is one that has become better known, and surprisingly short (75 minutes) for a major production.

she wins a trip to new york city. she's determined not to miss a moment of excitement in the big city. but when medical tests show the truth, hazel isn't sure what to do! wackiness ensues. keep an eye out for margaret hamilton in the rocking chair! she will be the wicked witch in wizard of oz, in 1939! directed by william wellman. no oscars yet, but he'll win for star is born the next year, and be nominated for three more. this seems to be a restored print, but it's still pretty fuzzy. it's pretty good. remember the times in which it was made....", "small-town carole lombard (as hazel flagg) is mistakenly diagnosed with radiation poisoning, which draws the attention of an enterprising \"new york star\" reporter fredric march (as wally cook). although the two (separately) realize drunken bumpkin doctor charles winninger's diagnosis is in error, they go along with the ruse. ms. lombard wants to leave vermont, the land of \"yup\" and \"nope\", for the excitement of new york city; and, mr. march wants to make lombard's sob story a media sensation. wanna bet the two fall in love? \"nothing sacred\" offers a great cast and crew; some of it is exceptionally well-written (ben hecht is sharply observant), but this film has not aged well. most obviously, its heavy-handed racist and stereotypical characterizations are more annoying than endearing. classic \"screwball\" comedies looked better in \"black & white\"; and, while it's certainly a welcome variation, the technicolor seems out of place. is nothing scared? lombard, usually considered an actress to photograph in \"black & white\", took a role thought of as for janet gaynor, who had just showed she looked great in color (\"a star is born\"). in \"nothing scared\", lombard is photographed well most of the time, but not always. certainly, she performs the part exceptionally, however. behind the scenes, director william wellman maneuvers the color cameras with style. the supporting cast is illustrious.***** nothing

fine supporting cast, a ben hecht screenplay, and william wellman directing, plus it's shot in beautiful technicolor, quite an achievement for 1937. and, there are many wonderful moments; frankly the film is worth watching just to see carole lombard in action. but despite all those great ingredients, it fails to reach the two heights it was trying to achieve, namely as a mockery of the press and as a screwball comedy. it is good at both things, just not outstanding versions of either. on the comedy side what seems to be missing is the frenetic pace and quick repartee of the great screwball films; this one has a slower pace and is more calm and obvious than it should be. but carole lombard ... wow !", "nothing sacred is a 1937 screwball romantic comedy filmed in technicolor and directed by william a. wellman. carole lombard and fredric march star in this somewhat unrealistic, over the top story, but the acting is solid, entertaining, and there is a strong supporting cast as well. the cynical nature of the press is portrayed in an entertaining manner and the scenes in the newspaper offices are well done, with excellent cinematography, lighting and snappy dialog. the snappy dialog accompanies a snappy pace that starts at the beginning with character caricatures and whimsical upbeat music and then a transition to city scenery and narration. the \"hello hazel\" skywriting is pretty cool.", "colorful screwball comedy with an auspicious premise where a reporter fredric march trying by any means makes amends with his newspaper boss walter connolly of a previous failure in a

decent enough for me to enjoy and the \"fight\" scene was probably my favorite scene in the entire movie. other than these specific elements, the movie kind of fell short of my expectations, which s

a woman in vermont named hazel flagg who everyone thinks has a deadly disease from radium poisoning but she really doesn't. a news reporter from new york named wally cook found out about her condition and decided it would be a great story to write about for the paper and he needed to redeem himself at his job because he recently wrote a story that created problems and even got him demoted. he was demoted to writing obituaries and needed to find a way to get his position back so he traveled to vermont in hopes of finding this so called dying woman. however, hazel flagg was not as pleasantly surprised as she should have been when she found out that she really wasn't dying and that it was just a misdiagnosis. she wanted to use the money she got from the factory where she got her \"disease\" and travel because it was a dream of hers and now she finally got the chance, so when wally came to town and said he would take her to new york city and pamper her she saw that as her opportunity to finally travel even though she was lying to a lot of people about her condition. she became famous in new york when everyone heard about her story and she loved the attention. she even got a key to the city! she also fell in love with wally while she was in new york with him. when the mayor found out that hazel was fine and it was all a lie, he decided it would be best to let the people of new york still believe she was dying rather than tell them it was all a lie. they put out a paper with the headline \"hazel vanishes\" and a picture of the suicide note she wrote saying how she wanted to face the end of her life alone. so while the people of new york thought hazel went away to die she was really on a ship with wally heading for the tropics. i didn't get why they didn't just have her tell everyone it was a lie rather than just make up more stories and have her write a fake suicide note. nothing sacred had an interesting plot and interesting characters but i just wasn't really a fan in the end.", "a film which has fredric march bitten in the calf by a toddler who subsequently runs askance like a rabid rabbit can't be but excellent. not to mention carole lombard's dazzling performance (i can't remember having seen her mediocre anyway) : how fun and beauty reach a perfect match ! the colors, as translated on the dvd, are fragile and uncertain, which adds a certain poetry to that otherwise quirky comedy. as for the \"meaning\" ! some of the front pages devoted to the supposedly terminally ill hazel flagg (carole lombard) might have inspired all the drivel that was supposed to be a tribute to unfortunate di. the details of the film are also of the neatest sort. one striking example is the heroines on horses show (another tribute to the \"dying\" hazel flagg- five minutes short, featuring lady godiva, helen of troy, pocahontas and some others, and managing to be as irrelevant and funny as can be. is the secret of these comedy, where beauty is a showcase of fun, lost for good ? the sublimely \"dark and handsome\" march, the deliciously \"classically blonde\" lombard revel in ridicule, and that's a feat no modern comedian seems able to perform. highly recommendable !", "an unscrupulous reporter takes advantage of a small town girl's supposed imminent death in order to manipulate the public and gain more sales. lombard however is not that imminent to death and she turns the tables and takes advantage of the situation. plays as well today as more than sixty years later which proves that while the people may have changed the media stays the same. a good biting satire. on a scale of one to ten..8", "after reading so many good reviews over the years for this comedy, i was disappointed when i actually saw it. it really was not particularly funny. in fact, i would have to say it was rather dull, and not up to the standards of lombard's other films. the \"heroine\", hazel flagg (carole lombard) was intended by the scriptwriters to be sympathetic, but i notice that she carries on with her fraudulent illness despite her occasional attacks of conscience. i find it impossible to like such a person or to care about her, and i thought frederick march's character to be a fool for wanting to marry a person willing to lie to the world for fame and gifts.", "here's why i love \"nothing sacred\": in many ways, it's a really strong, acidic antidote to frank capra's movies from around the same time. the common people of ns are mostly unseen, but they're clearly not shown as good, noble, taken-for-granted folks--they're presented as boobs, plain and simple. they get taken in by the whole hazel flagg scheme just as they might get taken in by longfellow deeds's awful poetry. they get manipulated not by powerful, cynical urbanites but ultimately by one of their own, a horse doctor from vermont who in turn toys with major newspapers and viennese doctors. the people from hazel flagg's small town are petty, snobbish, close-minded, and inclined to bite people on the leg for absolutely no reason. of course, walter connolly and his ilk don't get off the hook entirely; his reaction at learning he's been had must be one of the great comic moments of the 30s.i'm not a capra-hater, i'm just not totally comfortable with his veneration of \"common\" people in some of his pictures. for all his skill with comedy and actors, by the time we get to \"meet john doe\" i find his approach really cloying, and i'm skeptical that it's a good idea to venerate anybody based on their social class alone, whatever it may be. (although i have wondered what a meeting between capra and evelyn waugh would be like). i don't have any argument with his work through 1934, i just find some of his later work to be philosophically problematic. and that's why it's good to watch ns from time to time!", "it's hard to determine whether nothing sacred is a comedy or a drama, but if you decide to watch it all the way through, you'll find out it's a very strange comedy. carole lombard thinks she's dying, and when she finds out she's going to live at the exact moment reporter fredric march appears to interview her, she decides to hide the truth to get attention and sympathy. so, since the main storyline involves someone pretending she's dying, it's a little bit odd.if you like carole lombard in her classic screwball comedies, and you don't think there's anything wrong with joking about death, you might find this movie funnier than i did. i like carole much better in dramas, and the same goes for freddie. plus, it's a staple for screwball comedies to be extremely over-the-top and have one ridiculous antic after another, and in general, i prefer my movies to be a little more believable. but this is the only film in which you'll get to see carole in technicolor, and she herself really liked it, so if you're a fan, you can give it a whirl and see if you like it. you'll also see walter connolly, hattie mcdaniel, charles winninger, sig ruman, margaret hamilton, and monty woolley in the supporting cast.", "the 1937 screwball comedy nothing sacred is determined not to let you catch your breath, not for one nanosecond. as fast as an avalanche rolling down on you at racing car speed, it's like nothing you may have seen before. there's nothing subtle about nothing sacred.starring the gorgeous carole lombard, whose aristocratic beauty didn't quite hide a mischievous and wicked sense of humor and a stopwatch sense of timing, nothing sacred purports to be the story of hazel flagg, a small-town woman who is dying of radium poisoning – a hilarious premise, you must admit. but nothing is as it seems in nothing sacred. hazel is dying of boredom, not radium poisoning, and to get out of town and go to town, as it were. she seizes upon a seedy manhattan newspaperman's wretched attempt to redeem his reputation after a silly hoax goes awry. as cynical as a pawnbroker being offered the crown jewels of england by a ragged hobo, the reporter, played by fredric march, sees corruption and self-aggrandizement everywhere, but especially in his own profession. he also sees hazel as his way back to grace and brings her to gotham.as manipulative as lady macbeth, though much cuter, hazel takes new york city by storm. she becomes a two-week wonder. she gets a key to the city; flashbulbs pop everywhere she goes; teary-eyed sob-sisters weep over her gallantry and courage; and newspapers devote their front-pages to her – the whole nine yards of instant celebrity-hood.but master screenwriter ben hecht's intention is much more devious than an open-mouthed recounting of still another flash-in-the-pan. with hilarious effect, he peels away the pretensions of doctors, politicians, do-gooders and, especially, the newspaper business. you don't dare turn away for a second during hazel's wild romp. everybody speaks with a forked tongue here – quickly, hilariously, deceitfully and colorfully. (ben hecht's command of contemporary slang of the '30s is something splendidiferous, if not spanglorious.)filmed in an early technicolor process, the available prints of nothing sacred have not aged well: with new york city coming across as a sort of muddy land of oz (the skyscrapers look good, though.) costumes are outlandish, major sets are tasteless, even vulgar – doubtlessly on purpose, and – this is a surprise in a major studio's product – editing is a bit slipshod (a small-town doctor's office has a high cathedral-like ceiling, with an overlooked set of studio klieg lights popping up in one scene (at approx 13:44 into the film), only to disappear in the next (15:00). director william wellman, himself a world war i fighter pilot, also spends an inordinate amount of time on aerial shots, which, though offering a fascinating glimpse of the city as it was eighty years ago, don't exactly push along the plot. all this, curiously enough, serves the film writer's intention rather well, turning the movie into a form of not-quite-human puppet show. the opening credits may have had this in mind, giving this away with an odd and eerie display of frightening doll caricatures of the cast. oscar levant's lush music, with the additional help of alfred newman and max steiner, and raymond scott's quintette, punctuates the movie with a sophisticated richness that never intrudes. the cast included some well-known names of the time, not all of them credited: charles winninger, walter connolly, frank fay, boxer maxie rosenbloom, margaret hamilton, billy barty (as the kid who bites fredric march's leg – don't ask!), jinx falkenburg, hedda hopper, aileen pringle, hattie mcdaniel, leonid kinskey, and, as one of a quartet of rather weird german medical specialists, yale drama professor monty (the man who came to dinner) woolley.a lot of other talent was called in for this brief 73-minute movie, including the uncredited writing of david o. selznick, moss hart, sidney howard, george s. kaufman, ring lardner, jr. and budd schulberg, among others. (scenarist ben hecht took only two weeks to write the script – he was said to be the fastest as well as the highest-paid screenwriter in hollywood – and messrs. selznick and wellman may have felt the need for some additional polishing. while ben hecht was a much-honored scriptwriter – he wrote over 70 movies, was nominated for six oscars, and won two, including the first oscar ever for original screenplay, for underworld, 1927 – his scripts, to the hollywood moguls, still were nothing sacred.)", "this is screwball comedy at its very best with one of the sharpest screen writers of hollywood behind the scenes, ben hecht, crowding the film with titbits of good humour and astute intelligence, and the story is simply ingenious. it's good-humoured irony all the way, recklessly making fun of journalism and ruthlessly dissecting the trade, as the main theme of the film is fake. everything is faked in this film, everyone lives on the staging of frauds, it's all delusion and deceit, nothing is real, and to be part of it you have to play a fraudulent role yourself. fredric march as the failed journalist who always gets the wrong story is always wonderful as an alcoholic, but there are many alcoholics here, one more hilarious than the other. but the main comedienne is of course carole lombard, here at her very best, and she would last like that for another eight years before her tragic accident and demise. the caricature of new york press life here is almost universal in its hilarious good humour - there is no meanness, only lovable parody. the best sequence is perhaps the wrestling match, where fredric march and carole lombard gets bombarded by bodies flying around in a hysterically funny rendering of this absurd sport. it's all in colour as well, which adds plenty of cream and sugar to the banquet of enjoyment.", "ok, as an industry professional, and the recipient of two degrees in film history, i felt obligated to watch this \"classic.\" surprisingly, i find it tedious and unlikeable. i've never been a big lombard fan - too ditsy, in a cameron diaz (pardon the comparison) sort of way. scene after unfunny scene puzzled me. granted, a 1937 film is going to feel dated, but there are so many comedies from that period which still hold up to the passage of time........just watch \"the women\" from 1939, for instance.of course, today, a person who attempted lombard's \"charade\" would end up in prison, or at least the subject of some nasty lawsuits. and what's the deal with giving margaret hamilton such a large credit for about a minute of screen time?? please notice that hattie went uncredited for equal time. (the overall treatment of minorities will make you squirm.)while sitting here typing this comment, i realize that i really dislike this film. several times during the screening, i almost shut it off, but felt i owed a \"classic\" the benefit of a doubt.and to address some previous observations, i also wondered about the staging of some scenes, like the dialogue behind the tree limb, and the conversation behind boxes on a wharf - numerous other camera angles that were annoying, rather than \"artistic.\"", "the film had surprisingly very good taste. it incorporated both color picture and black and white into one film but alternated at just the right scenes. the color picture did add to the crazy feel of the film. all the colors were very vibrant, it was just like the plot. the camera sometimes shot from a far which made you feel very distant from the story. most of the actors were good. it was a very wild feeling while watching it, since the characters were all over the place.the plot was actually pretty organized considering the way it played out. it was just a silly film, there was an actually suspenseful underline to it. enjoyable and enhancing film!", "i greatly enjoyed seeing this movie if only to watch carole lombard in color.by today's standard the film is dated but considering it's over 75 years old, it holds up well for a romantic comedy.lombard has good comedic timing and is a beauty to behold. there are some outtakes at the archive.org site and you can see why clark gable deeply loved her. there are some excellent high contrast scenes of her portrait that is worth viewing for that alone. maybe i have an infatuation with lombard, if so it's a good one that i'm happy to have.the lead male doesn't really equal lombard in skills or talent.the supporting cast ia adequate but nothing special.production values were decent.overall the film needs a good restoration as the technicolor is showing its limits on the version i watched.", "after watching this movie,one thing really struck me:how talented carole lombard was as an actress.she has a real gift for comedy,of which there is a fair amount in this film.i found i very funny,but beyond that,i just thought it was well written,and even more relevant today than back then.it basically skewers every imaginable target,including the price of fame,and paints pretty much everybody as phonies,when you you get right down to it.even your average every day person is painted with that brush.but this is also a romance and drama,and it also works on those levels.fredric march is the male lead,and he does pretty well in the role.the supporting players are also good,but,like i said,it is carole lombard who steals the show.i had a great time watching this film,and highly recommend it.my vote for nothing sacred:8.5/10", "being as i am not all that big on screwball comedies, i didn't expect much from nothing sacred. i came away from this movie pleasantly surprised. there was a subtlety to the movie that leaned more toward my taste of dark humor than slapstick that i really appreciated. hazel wasn't just a shrieking girl; she was much more than that. her characterization had layers and depended on what she was going through or who she was with. i found myself really enjoying the romance which was only part of the movie, rather than the entire purpose. much of this movie was devoted to discussing the world of media and the fascination with sorrow and melodrama that seems to be central to our media to this day. another thing that i really loved was how this was filmed. there were loads of interesting camera shots where the focus wasn't quite where you expected it to be. i loved the bit where wally and walter were discussing hazel with a big bunch of flowers between them, each popping their head forward when they spoke. it took what could have been a throwaway conversation and made it visually interesting and appealing.all around a really great movie that is steps above the screwball comedy genre.", "i watched this movie with my grandma who is one huge carole lombard fan. she promised me that this movie was going to be a treat and it was! both lombard and march did a wonderful job in this film. the only thing that is really sad and ironic about this movie is the fact that the plot revolved mostly on hazel flagg's death and carole lombard later died a very tragic and early death. other than that, the movie is very funny! i highly recommend it.", "nothing sacred (1937) : brief review -nothing special about wellman's screwball comedy, even with carole lombard's typical hysterical chatter. just a year before this, carole lombard starred in \"my man godfrey\" (1936), which is perhaps her most memorable comedy ever. that chatterbox character never looked so funny and dangling. she carries the same chattering accent here and tries to save this comedy, but alas. there is no enough substance in the end to make a good comedy. wellman's comedy is about a journalist who is blamed for fake news and now wants to redeem himself. he learns about a girl who is dying of radium poisoning. however, just before he meets her, she learns that she has nothing to worry about. yet, she goes to new york with the journalist just to get rid of her boring life in her small town. she becomes a sensation, a public hero, and an idol for every citizen of the city. as expected, the journalist and she fall in love, but what would they both do to hide the fact that she is not dying after all and the public will lynch them for playing with their feelings? nothing sacred seemed like a decent comedy in the first half, but it doesn't have a substantial storyline in the second half. the climax looks too stupid to believe. the only good thing about this film has to be carole lombard and fredric march's performances. they couldn't share the chemistry because the narrative hardly has any scenes for them to romance each other, except that one kissing scene in the dark beside the river. the film feels depressive on occasions, but some of those crying scenes are funny too. it was too early to crack the idea of a comedy out of a dying person, and everyone around it is only weeping, so it was a fair attempt. william wellman could have worked more on the story and gotten the climax right, and then it would have ended up as a \"good comedy.\" for now, i'd say it's an average affair.rating - 5/10*by - #samthebestest.", "an amazing film, is this the only technicolor screwball comedy?? besides the terrific performances by carole lombard and fredric march, this movie is chocked fill with some of the funniest character actors of the era, charles winninger, walter connolly (both simply brilliant), margaret hamilton, hedda hopper, sig ruman, and frank fay, not to mention an amazing orchestral score by oscar lavant and 'novelty' jazz by the then-super popular raymond scott quintet.on top of everything else, one hellava cynical funny script by ben hecht.this move simply has everything.", "this film has an excellent cast and it's a real pleasure to see carole lombard, especially in technicolor.but the story is lackluster and only moderately funny. other reviewers have detailed its challenging premise. when the main character is not very likable, comedy is difficult. i think they were trying for screwball, but the result was cartoonish.", "new yorkers take to heart a young woman who is facing imminent and tragic death from radium poisoning but who turns out to be completely healthy and enjoying (at first) all the attention. the film is a fun 'screwball comedy' that skewers celebrity obsession, the self-serving faux-sentimentality of the media, and the public's ability to go overboard in attempts to vicariously experience tragedy. both star carol lombard and the script deftly flirt with the absurd but avoid overt silliness and fredric march makes a good straight-man who, of course, falls in love with the lovely but not-dying girl. the secondary cast is fine and there is a great scene with the one-of-a-kind margaret hamilton (soon to be immortalised as the 'wicked witch of the west'). some of the humor is dated (i had to look up calvin coolidge to get the joke about laconic vermont villagers) but the film remains funny and oddly relevant (but a lot less cynical than a 'fake news' comedy would be these days). some modern viewers may find the brief scenes featuring racial stereotypes distasteful but they are not exploitive or mean-spirited but rather (imo) simply reflect humour from a different era. so sad that lombard's career was tragically cut short.", "the film has been perceived as a satire on yellow journalism due to hect'd experience. there's a key line in which a ny journalst is told: a newspaperman? the hand of god reaching down into the mire couldn't elevate one of them to the depth of degradation.", "new york city is full of fakes and liars looking to get ahead. newspaper reporter wally cook (fredric march) is blamed for a fake african noble hosting a charity gala. he is demoted to write obituary. he begs for a second chance to write about hazel flagg (carole lombard) who is dying of radium poisoning. he goes to her small town to interview her. unbeknownst to him, her diagnosis is a mistake. she's desperate to go to a big city like new york. when wally offers to take her there, she sees no other option than to lie.this is an early technicolor screwball comedy. it's interesting to see the color movement in a romantic comedy. i wonder if they went out of their way to bring bright colors onto the screen. as for the plot, the premise is not compelling enough and the rooting interest is muddled. it doesn't make the ship that worthwhile. the movie is screwy but i'm not sure that it's screwball. the colors are more intriguing than the story itself. it is technically interesting but i don't buy the couple.", "this film had me almost literally crying from laughter at times, a great and well executed and very over the top screwball. with extremely well written lines that take pot shots at all of the hypocrisies that society has to give, and making them comical. i'm not much of a comedy person, but this movie had me sucked in from start to finish, it has come under a lot of criticism, but it has a certain charm i can't put my finger on. not sure if it's the excellent combination of carole lombard and fredric march creating a pair of extremely likable protagonists, the execution of each gag and joke, or the well done cinematography and well executed lines. it all comes together to make a film that i can adore, and enjoy very thoroughly all the way to the end. i'd recommend this film to any light of heart cynic i know.", "a rom-com from 1937 starring fredric

conceit in this story of a shamed reporter, played by march, exposed for trying to pass off an african american man as a foreign king is desperate for a story that will wow readers but also put him into the good graces of his editor. in comes lombard's character, who believes she's dying from exposure to radiation (when really she isn't, it was just a daffy conclusion by her hometown doctor who's a bit of a lush) but the acceptance & love of her community forces her to keep up the facade. march thinks he has a winner in his hands & soon introduces her to the big cities power players & movers & shakers which makes her plight that much more precarious since more eyes are on her than ever before. march then falls in love w/her which makes her want to spill the beans. working in a form (rather than in the note of c w/the last march comedy i reviewed there goes my heart), this story, shot wonderfully in early color (giving the film an almost norman rockwellesque sheen to the palette)

this as one of the best but not as good as the best, ie films such as bringing up baby and his girl friday. it's a joy to behold, but only as long as your vein of cynicism is deeper than your belief in human integrity. i suppose using a terminal illness as a vehicle could be called production for use in defence though.young woman carole lombard in warsaw, vt is (mis)diagnosed with terminal radium poisoning and is brought to new york, ny by morning star ace reporter frederic march, to be feted until her (un)timely end. everyone is wracked with one emotion or another, even after the revealing of the truth, the fun is in the sensationalist sentimentalism, the slick manipulation of the public's - and our - emotions, and how on earth it can all be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. serial cynic ben hecht wrote the screenplay up to his usual throwaway witty style, wellman directed it er well if with a few odd obscuring touches, the cast were excellent especially the 50 year old ferris wheel and werewolf walter connelly. in real life it turned out he had only three years left to live and lombard five. unfortunately from the copy i've got the colour looks a little washed out now, i can only hope disney's remaster has done it justice.it's an entertaining movie, my only problem with it was the lack of basic personal honour shown by all was also shown to be rewarded – lying and cynicism from the first to the last minute is all that is required from people to get by. if hecht was living in these days of newspaper hacking of dead children's mobile phones he would have seen for himself, and who knows maybe even to his disgust just how far the amusing ethos of \"nothing is sacred\" has come.", "this screwball comedy was really good. i had just previous to seeing this film saw \"my man godfrey\" also starring carole lombard. what an actress. she's just phenomenal. i wasn't sure if it was just her role in \"my man godfrey\" that portrayed her as hilarious, or if it was all of her films. after seeing \"nothing sacred\" i can easily say it's all her films that she's brilliant. she just makes the film what it is and brings so much to the table. what i really loved about this film, which is my main reason to see any film, is the story/plot. it was all really well done. probably my favorite part of the film was when hazel is given the key to the city. i just thought it was ironic and all because she isn't sick or anything. but besides that the movie in its entirety was very well shot and well done in general. i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy

from a decidedly cynical attitude; an observation with which we heartily concur. in fact, not only do we agree, but we must reply with a loud and clear, \"do you think!\"(duh!)with a writer like mr. ben hecht behind the screenplay, is it a wonder that this pull no punches look at the american pop-culture scene is as sharp-edged as it is. mr. hecht's background as a newspaperman provided him not only with a fine tuning for his god-given talents as a writer; but also gave him and us a backstage view of what has been called \"journalism.\" the story revolves around a phony tragedy, a $elfi$h rating$ oriented new$paper campaign and how all of this plays out against the various 'cultural' events of the city of new york. from the awarding of the traditional \"key to the city\" to a wrestling match at the garden, we discover that the honoring \"victim\" (carole lombard) is secondary to self aggrandizement and monetary cons$ideration$ for the pre$enter$.without the element of the very caustic humor that permeates this film throughout, it would be a very difficult story to view. it would rank right up there with death of a salesman, sophie's choice and dondi.", "this is a classic with carole lombard. in one of the previous comments, it was mentioned that the color was off a bit and the dvd was blamed. although the dvd transfer may be awful too, i think this movie may have been made in the original 2 strip technicolor process (since it was in 1937) which always has a blue tinge to it. it was probably not the vivid and beautiful 3 strip process which i think first appeared in 1939 with gone with the wind and the wizard of oz (at least for major studio releases).can anyone confirm this?the movie has a wonderful performance from lombard which i find her second best, the best being her performance in my man godfrey. the supporting cast is excellent with the exception of march, who i always found to be a \"hammy\" actor. that style of acting was pretty normal back then -

cynical people. flagg and her sponsor in nothing scared are opportunists and they are living in our world of structure that is phony. mention of racism is odd. the giant black man who 'leans' on hotel

lives(1946). the supporting roles as played by walter connoly as the newspaper editor and charles winninger as the the horse doctor are superb. this zany farce is done in a manner that they just can't duplicate today or probably not since the 1950s and it is a joy to behold. this is a great comedy and one that is a treasure and a gem-just appreciate that they once made a bunch of comedies of this quality-this is one of the greatones-though i wouldn't quite put it in the masterwork/all-time great category.", "i actually signed up with an account here at imdb just to comment on this film. i felt obligated to spare others from this movie! my wife and i really enjoy \"old\" movies (from the 30's and 40's), but this flick was truly in the \"b\" category. the script, the acting, the editing, the directing, the whole thing was utter nonsense. the directorial choices, such as the scene where part of the conversation occurs behind a tree limb, seemed more like mistakes than artistry. it was just ridiculous, and not in a good way (we found ourselves giving each other bewildered looks instead of chuckling at the \"comedy\"). i feel like i really want that 75 minutes of my life back. i'd give the dvd away, but i wouldn't want to inflict that on anybody else. for two big-name screen artists (lombard and march), this film must have been one of those embarrassing memories they hoped nobody would discover existed. four thumbs down!", "if not always robustly funny, 'nothing sacred' is certainly consistently entertaining. the writing is sharp and witty, with every scene either cementing the absurdity of the scenario, or building into the next moment that does. on top of the essential humor, the movie presents quite the series of spectacles as beloved hazel flagg is shown the sights and sounds of new york and honored wherever she goes. with that the production also bears mindful consideration for details like costume design, hair and makeup, and set design. at not even 80 minutes long, this is a fun ride worth taking if you have the chance.excellent and invigorating as the screenplay is, the movie owes just as much success to the outstanding comedic performances of the entire cast. carole lombard above all absolutely shines, her natural grace and charisma a fantastic contrast to the bumbling and increasingly desperate measures hazel takes to maintain the facade. of course this is hardly to count out co-stars including fredric march, charles winninger, walter connolly, or margaret hamilton, who to our delight all lean into their wonderfully exaggerated characters. as they do, the actors help to manifest strong, surprising thematic content about the corrupting power and influence of lies.it's important to acknowledge some unseemly, underhanded racism that also appears in the film in passing, somewhat dampening enthusiasm for the show. there's also a questionable line or two late in the runtime concerning the suggested relationship between hazel and reporter wally. then, too, some of the editing leaves a bit to be desired, especially when it comes to transitions. putting these points aside, though, the combination of physical comedy, situational humor, and clever dialogue, to say nothing of marvelous acting, works to build a roundly very funny, well made picture. to speak at greater length would begin to reveal details; suffice to say that this is a highly enjoyable, engaging classic. it's relatively short, broadly appropriate for all ages, and ably keeps our attention. wherever you're able to watch it, i highly recommend 'nothing sacred.'", "learning about this kind of comedy made me laugh in the beginning, but as i watched more and more of this kind of humor i began to realize how much i started to like it. the way the angles of the camera worked throughout the movie made the puns throughout the movie funny and the lighting had a lot to do with the mood of the film. the story line was very amusing and you often get caught wondering when the bottom is going to fall out for \"poor\" hazel flatt. the acting was sort of bad but i liked it anyway, it was corny. the lead character often acted like the damsel in distress,

extremely innovative hollywood actresses carole lombard, rosalind russell and mae west through a retrospective (no angels).nothing sacred from 1937 is an impressive example of the physical acting of the exceptional actress carole lombard (1908-1942). she plays hazel flagg, a country bumpkin from the midwest who ends up in national headlines after being allegedly poisoned with a radioactive substance. it's just a shame that it soon becomes clear that it's a case of mix-up. the supposedly terminally ill woman still has a long life ahead of her. a sensational reporter (fredric march, 1897-1975, two oscars!), who has now developed a crush on her, tries to help her. this leads to a crazy scene. to make it seem as if hazel is exhausted to death, she and her beau start a brilliant fight, which is of course anything but politically correct, but is incredibly funny. that was the trademark of carole lombard, who unfortunately died far too early in a plane crash: physical slapstick to the extreme, without considering how the breathtaking blonde looks and comes across!great and wonderfully wild! fearless and straightforward, academy award nominee carole lombard simply throws all gender stereotypes overboard. you had to have the courage to do something like that in the hollywood studio system, especially after the pre-code era!it was produced by the independent david o.

can also be seen in a smaller role.even a film that is now 85 years old can definitely be worth seeing!", "very amusing old movie combining a conventional romantic comedy with an ironical approach on yellow press and charlatanism, and a touch of camp and of dark humor. as i read elsewhere, it is a screwball comedy, that is, a subgenre of the romantic comedy that satirizes the traditional love story and that was popular between early 1930s and early 1950s. while the movie goes well until the nice ending, its first 27 minutes are no less than hilarious. i laughed loud! i loved the town warsaw, vermont, which may be seen as a character itself, with really funny denizens. i also liked a lot, previously, the sultan of marzipan \"from the orient\", and, before it, the charming opening credits featuring caricature action figures of the leading actors and cartoon images in papers which shot being changed by live action hands. deffinitely, not a movie to be forgotten, certainly worth watching!", "nothing scared was another great screwball comedy directed by william wellman. it starred carole lombard and fredric march. carole lombard was great in this movie just like she was in my man godfrey. she was a woman name hazel who supposedly diagnosed with radium poisoning. she does a great job hiding the fact that she actually doesn't have the poison. she was very believable. wally was a newsman who was looking for hazel. they wanted to bring her to new york before she died to get the newspaper the publicity it needed. she decided to not tell the truth and live with the publicity like she was a celebrity. they were both perfect for each other which made it work. wally fell for her throughout the movie still without knowing she was faking it. he had to learn the hard way that she actually was faking it but still loved her even after finding out. i thought the color in this movie was pretty good for that time. it made it a little easier to watch.", "less than honest news reporting--some people would call it 'fake news'-- has been around for a long, long time. former newspaper reporter ben hecht's script for the movie november 1937's \"nothing sacred\" was a scathing satire on how the news media concocts a fictional story to increase its readership, this one capitalizing on a woman's unique fatal illness. rare for 'screwball comedies' in the 1930s, this david o. selznick-produced movie was filmed in technicolor.carole lombard stars as a factory worker who's misdiagnosed by her hard-drinking physician as dying from radium poisoning she supposedly was exposed to at work. a story in a local paper in the fictitious vermont town of warsaw makes its way to new york city, where the morning star newspaper sends reporter wally cook (frederic march) to investigate. while he's snooping around the unfriendly town, hazel flagg (lombard) finds out from her doctor, dr. enoch downer (charles winninger), that he was wrong in his original diagnosis. shortly after, hazel is questioned by wally, who says his paper wants to fly her down to new york so he could write about her final days. desperate to get away from vermont to enjoy the big apple, hazel conceals to him the latest prognosis from her doctor.\"even though this was made in 1937, only a few decades into hollywood's existence, it ruthlessly mocks the public's fascination with fleeting celebrity,\" describes film reviewer morgan lewis. \"it could be taken as a satire of all the morbid reality television programs based on following celebrities around, except it was created decades before any of those programs existed.\" the hype hazel receives in the city from cook's teary articles is so over-the-top that it becomes comical. hecht, who spent years working at chicago newspapers, adapted his script from a james street story called 'letter to the editor.' hecht left the project after producer selznick rejected his desire to have john barrymore play the reporter because of the actor's excessive drinking. several writers were called in to shape the final screenplay, including budd schulberg, dorothy parker, moss hart and george s. kaufman.\"nothing sacred\" has earned classical status because of its brutally honest portrayal of the newspaper owners' greediness. the morning star's editor, oliver stone (walter connolly), epitomizes the money-obsessed people surrounding hazel when she's brought to new york: he cares more for the profitability of his newspaper's increase in circulation of its coverage of hazel's demise than he is about her well-being. \"the dying hazel becomes a larger-than-life persona that transcends hazel herself,\" notes film critic raquel stecher. \"the community wants a martyr they can fawn over and celebrate. in the end it didn't matter if hazel was for real or not.\"lombard ranked \"nothing sacred\" as her favorite film, and was the only movie of hers filmed in color. the actress was known as a practical joker on and off the set. frustrated with her many attempts to get director william wellman's attention, she arranged a handful of strong men on the film crew to slip him into a straight jacket so he would listen to her. wellman learned his lesson and demonstrated to her how to tackle frederic march during a particularly physical sequence where both characters are beating up each another.\"nothing sacred\" is also known for its spectacular air and river footage of new york city in the 1930s. the movie was the first to show color rear screen projection and process effect shots of the city while the main characters were filmed inside the studio. members of the american film institute nominated it for one of the funniest movies as well as the greatest love stories ever made in cinema. hecht's screenplay was the basis for the 1953 broadway musical \"hazel flagg,\" which was adapted into the dean martin and jerry lewis 1954 comedy \"living it up.\"", "nothing sacred (1937) *** (out of 5) classic screwball comedy has a disgraced reporter (fredric march) trying to clear his name with a true story of a woman (carole lombard) dying of radiation poisoning. what the reporter doesn't know is that the woman is faking the illness for a trip to new york. overall i enjoyed this film but i wouldn't call it one of the greatest comedies ever made. i found the story to be rather mean and i think this took away some of the laughs for me but there's no denying the charm between the two stars. the fight towards the end of the film is certainly a classic moment as is a lot of the dialogue, which is fast and sharp. the supporting cast also adds a lot to the film with charles winninger as the doctor going along with the fraud and walter connolly as march's editor. the technicolor didn't really get to have an effect as the print quality was pretty poor from start to finish with the colors giving lombard the look of a gray faced zombie.", "\"nothing scared\" starring frederic march and carole lombard was a very good screwball comedy and kept you very entertained throughout the whole movie. it was a type of humor that you don't see too often but i definitely understood the humor and laughed a lot.carol lombard plays a great role in this movie by being very funny playing a character who has a fake sickness of radium poisoning and thinks that she's going to die. that gets ruined towards the end when the scientist find out that she is lying and catch her. this movie displayed an unusual type of comedy (screwball) but it was very funny to me. this was a great film and it set the tone

very loosely enforced in the 60s. i was not there in the 60s but it is a well known fact on campus and by alumni. i have never heard anything of that nature and i believe they made it worse than it really was in order to make people watch it and enjoy reading the book. all in all the book is much better than the movie. read the book don't watch the movie, or at least read the book first.", "it's 1964 at the carolina military institute. returning for his senior year as a cadet, hunky david keith (as will \"bubba\" mcclean) and his pals discover the freshman \"knobs\" include, for the first time, a young black man. as you might expect, he is the victim of racial hatred. old-timer robert prosky (as \"the bear\") enlists mr. keith's help in watching over the black cadet, mark breland (as pearce). keith gets reluctant help from his three roommates - piano playing mitchell lichtenstein (as tradd st. croix), weight-lifting rick rossovich (as dante \"pig\" pignetti), and italian elvis fan john lavachielli (as mark santoro).keith and his friends participate in \"hell night\" with the usual shenanigans. of course, \"scumbags,\" \"maggots,\" and \"faggots\" are encouraged to vacate the premises. overweight malcolm danare (as poteete) is the first casualty. then, a (not so) secret organization known as \"the ten\" targets mr. breland. but, \"the lords of discipline\" isn't really about breland or his race. rather, it's a mystery thriller focusing on keith and his roommates. and, even then, it's not much of a mystery. most enjoyable are keith and his three roommates, who manage to be appealing in some unappealing (and obvious) roles.****** the lords of discipline (2/18/83) franc roddam ~ david keith, mitchell lichtenstein, rick rossovich, robert prosky", "i will give this movie a grudging o.k. i feel the book was superior in all respects but hey, how can a movie live up to pat conroy's book. i was in the military for 8 years and a product of conroy's 'damaged goods' sickness of the south. i had the privilige of attending that place but turned it down in favor of another school some 30 years ago. but please bear in mind that much has changed in the military and much of the brutality of the school has gone away with all the attention heaved upon it. i noticed that many of the readers comments indicate about the sadism but remember, pat conroy attended the citadel in 1963 to 1967 when there were not the federal laws and scutiny that exists in 2006. i understand much of conroy's distrust and bitterness about having attended then refused the commission for lack of a better word than conscience objector. i don't have a problem with that and can now relate having seen many of my fellow soldiers refuse to come back to service after the gulf war started in 1990. please read the book first and look deep into what conroy is trying to impart to all of us. it is similar to 'born on the 4th of july.' don't look at today's citadel with any type of similarity to what went on over 40 years ago. like they say, it's gone with the wind...", "i enjoyed this movie thoroughly. now i have never read the novel it is based on so i am not disillusioned by how \"bland\" an adaptation this is, but i must say that this was an interesting, intriguing and enjoyable film. it was deep and thought provoking and provided an insight into what was... and possibly still is considered to be the making of a man and a soldier.also, the fact that it is a veritable melting pot of future stars and character actors doesn't hurt. david keith as a likeable character? michael biehn and bill paxton, a year before making terminator together, a few years before making aliens and ages before making tombstone. judge reinhold, rick rossovich (the guy from roxanne and pacific blue), matt frewer (he looks so young!!!), the fat guy out of godzilla (he is great). it was interesting seeing all these people in these roles, big and small.moral of the story, great flick :)", "the movie is adequate and casting for \"the bear\" was perfect. the film lost the eliminate of mystery and intrigue the book had. by showing \"the ten\" to early and on campus they stole from the mythology of the fraternity. on the other hand, it is impossible to make a film that lives up to a conroy novel as their is just too much. if a producer was smart they would hire pat conroy to make a tv series out of any one of his novels. i don't mean a mini series, but an actual tv series that would probably need to run three seasons. if conroy didn't want to write the series than david e. kelley could possibly do justice to many of conroy's novels or in the case of the lords of discipline arron sorkin could possibly write it. obviously pat would be the ideal writer though. trying to do any conroy novel in a two or even three hour film is just ridiculous. that's why \"the prince of tides\" was such a bad film. it did not stand a chance of having even the same story line as the novel because the real story could not be covered by a film.", "will mclean (david keith) is a senior cadet at the carolina military institute, a school that promises to make men of honor but practises brutal hazing to freshmen. mclean's roommates are dante pignetti (rick rossovich), mark santoro and tradd st. croix. in the time spent there mclean will join all the academy's activities (except breaking new cadets) and will see the corruption inside the institute, and will also try to unmask it (without some trouble and pignetti getting expelled).despite i have not read the original novel lords of discipline i still liked the movie because it has some very good acting by everyone. i am not a huge david keith fan but here he was very good as the lead, rick rossovich was very funny as the cadet that didn't stopped screaming, while michael biehn and judge reinhold give some of their best performances in their careers. the plot was great as there were lots of twists and turns when the leads were finding the truth.overall, a good militar academy drama that excedded my expectations as i was very surprised that i liked it very much. if you are searching something underrated from the 1980s, then this is for you.", "here is a good movie showing why one should not bother with either the military or it's pissant little institutions of higher learning. yes the novel is 10 times better, but this is not a bad film either. do these military schools really develop character and produce real men or do they brainwash and engender false codes of honor and loyalty thereby turning out highly tuned robots to fight for all the real reasons wars are waged - oil, money, and population control? the smart money would bypass entering these halls of insanity.", "the movie itself was mediocre-- but having read pat conroy's incredible novel, filled with cynicism, cruelty, depth, and of cource, deceit-- all that good stuff. alas, without a love interest, the myriad losses, and the absolutely imperative dips into the depths of senior private will mclean's psyche, this movie is simply a hollow time-waster about a southern military school. read the book, skip the film-- or better yet (since the film was actually rather enjoyable) see the film first, and then bask in the sheer, dark goodness of pat conroy's writing. if only there were no pat conroy novel, this movie would be an enjoyable flick... oh well.", "noting that a good deal of the lords of discipline was filmed in charleston, south carolina and the school our characters attend is the carolina military institute, i was amazed that the citadel lent itself to this production. from what i understand it can still be a frightening place. only in the past decade did they get around to admitting women.this story is set in 1964 and this school is now getting around to admitting its first black cadet. a lot of special interests want to see mark breland fail. te usual hazing a plebe gets is with some real menace. another one folks aren't fond of is malcolm danare and things end tragically for him.second in command robert prosky asks a favorite cadet upperclassman david keith to keep an eye on breland. remember this is 1964 and the civil rights era is upon us and i think prosky doesn't want too many yankee faces looking into the school.that doesn't mean anything for a certain secret elite society among the cadets called the ten. they want to uphold the traditional (read racist) ways and this bunch would have been proud to serve with nathan bedford forrest.. michael biehn heads it currently and he's a piece of work. this was the first of many roles like this for biehn. he's a really menacing guy.keith and his three roommates mitchell lichtenstein, rick rossovich, and john lachiavelli get targeted. the final confrontation between keith and commandant g.d. spradlin is beautifully played.one more thing. the commandant of the citadel in 1964 was mark clark and one hopes the american commander of the italian theater in world war 2 did not countenance these sort of doings.the lords of discipline is a fine film telling of times we hope have passed.", "as a cadet who experienced a very similar situation, i found the story to be very close to the truth. i enjoyed watching the movie although most (if not all) of the performances were stilted and stuffy! i was a former r.o.t.c. cadet, who was actually supposed to attend the citadel (the institution that movie supposedly depicts) and attended another military college...i found the depictions very close to some of the \"on-goings\" of military college life for cadets (at that time), including some of the treatment of cadets with different ethnic backgrounds.the performances of the \"actors\" in this movie showed their inexperience at that time. although, some of those actors learned from the experience and are some of the best known character actors, although mostly in comedic roles (i wonder, why?) of current films, including: judge reinhold and \"wild\" bill paxton.i recommend this film as a film to be watched by those learning how to act. it is a prime example of what not to do. hopefully, no one imitates any of the acting in this film but hopefully they will use it as a learning tool.", "set in a carolina officer cadet school the lords of discipline tells the story of a racist guild within the school who are hell bent on making sure no black cadet will ever be at the passing out parade . it`s a fairly good film but had the potential to be so much better . the problem i had is that it takes place through the eyes of cadre officer will who i thought just a little bit too fine , upstanding and moral to take seriously and it`s because of this the film doesn`t reach the heights it could have . it should also be pointed out because it`s filmed in england doubling as an american military base i couldn`t help but be reminded of the first half of full metal jacket , it never helps a movie comparing it to that classic segment but as i said lords of discipline is an entertaining enough movie that features a bunch of actors who almost became stars in the 1980s . see if you can spot them", "the lords of discipline is a slow-moving, dull, boring, and badly acted 1980s film. the characters come off as cartoonish. david keith is likable enough, and does a fair job considering what he has to deal with. the rest of the cast overplays their parts and none of them come across as real. the southern accents are terrible, and it's hard to figure if this is a military college or a high school military school. regardless, everyone in the cast is way to old to be students in either case. the worst scene is when keith and his room mates kidnap a lawyer and tie him to a railroad track. the whole scene came across like a cartoon and the actor playing the lawyer gave a junior high school acting performance. forget the lords of discipline.", "i can talk about military school as i was third generation to attend a military school; my father and grandfather attended the same school. and i wanted to go; to escape from the small town syndrome. they wanted to shoot \"taps\" there, but we turned it down as, our president at the time, a retired 2 star general said, \"it portrayed the military school student as a radical.\" gee secret groups are bad. so public groups like gangs are forgotten? any organization will have good and bad in it. at the military school we had black, whites, asian, mexican, etc. the only color that mattered were the black, gray and blue of your uniform. time there mattered. if you were a new boy, (1 year of less) you were the lowest form of life, no matter what color you were. old boys, +1 year and who had signed our honor code, were the upper level. it didn't matter what color or how old. and when women started there, some of the older alumni had problems with that. but i am here to tell you, in the final years of life of that school (which was shut down to mis-management and money... gee always money) the female company was the best there. the military school, when i attended 1977-1983, was a great way to prepare young people for the future-be it in the military or in life. anyone who say different, well... i won't say what i think. if you didn't go to a military school, you don't know. just like being in the military. i am proud that i attended and still have more friends from than i can count from there, over 30 years later. how many can say that about the school you went to? numquam non paratus", "i saw this movie when it was first released. i have not seen it since. i hated it then. i hated it when i saw it today.i don't know why i should have expected more. it would be impossible to put any of the music or poetry in conroy's prose into a 2 hour movie script. it was a crime to even try.the only good thing about seeing this movie again was seeing michael biehn before the terminator, a nascent judge reinhold, robert prosky and a couple others as they were almost 20 years ago. there was nothing technically wrong with the movie, but it shared nothing with the book but its title and a couple of the character's names. lousy adaptation.", "the armed services of the u.s. have spent years trying to define and instill the core values that they wish the soldier, sailor, airman, marine, and coast guardsman to possess. the military realizes that not many people have learned those core values from their home life. induction into the service is a metamorphosis into a new life and it involves making over the former civilian into the servicemember -- body and mind. in this excellent fictional movie, the commandant and his \"ten\" lost track of the distinction between pride in their accomplishments and...elitism. will and the bear had honor. will's moral courage exemplified the core values that the military strives to teach its members today.", "if there were no pat conroy novel to compare this film to, the movie might fare better. gone is the \"love interest\" (major) and added is a much more upbeat ending. conroy's novels tend toward cynicism and this one is no different. keith and prosky do a good job of creating two of the main characters. there is some suspense toward the end, but too much is communicated too fast to be believable. location shots are impressive (england!) and the pacing is right. the music (howard blake) is weak. one would like to have seen this film directed by sam peckinpah or martin scorsese.", "it's a shame that the greatest book of all time turned out to be the worst movie...the acting was horrible, they took out major plot lines from the book (will falling in love) and in general ruined just about everything...i feel sorry for pat conroy.", "do you wish to understand the root causes of the abu ghraib scandal ? then watch the hollow military 'honor', the fake manhood, the very real macho 'ooohah !', the false piety and the pervasive hypocrisy displayed in this extraordinary movie, one of my all-time favorites. this movie is more about cultural ethics and values than about military life per se. here, the military milieu is a microcosm of american society in general. anybody who wishes to understand the deep causes of my lai and of abu ghraib should watch this movie carefully. the actors are almost all excellent, especially keith david, robert j. prosky and mark breland (whatever happened to him, as an actor ?) i have not read the book, so i cannot compare the movie to it. strictly as a movie, though, it ranks among the top 5 % in my book. i don't understand why it was filmed in england. are there not equivalent military academies in the united states ?", "edmund kean was a very famous shakespearian actor who played all of the bard's greatest roles. he once said maybe no actor can really do the bard justice. his plays and characters are so masterfully written and beautifully portrayed that no actor can really bring them to life. maybe this is the case with pat conroy's book the lords of discipline. i watched this film on june 14, 1986, it was the night before i left for basic training at fort jackson, south carolina. i watched it and wondered if my basic would be that hard! whats amazing is this is a film about a southern military academy, and yet it was filmed in england. they gave it the old college try and their level best, but this film is really wanting, i say again badly wanting, in comparison to conroy's masterful book. i have read it over and over a pleasure that never tires. this man is like a master magician or a skilled surgeon when it come to the english language and in creating characters that seem so real. will mclean, mark santoro, dante \"pig\" pignetti, colonel bear and the snobby general durrell all seemed so real to me. i have to admit that in the book i did not like pig's character at all. he was nothing but a bully and he was stupid and dishonest as well. he deserved to get thrown out of the academy for stealing gas. will was a fine young man who was so hilariously sarcastic. i thought that general durrell had to be the biggest blowhard who ever lived. he talked about honor but sure didn't live it. pat conroy attended the citadel in south carolina and this is what he based his book on. i was appalled when he described the brutal \"hazing\" that they put young plebes through. i could not believe that upperclassmen could be that sadistic. they were like the hitler youth. it was terrible. david keith was in an officer and a gentlemen the year before this film was made and gives a fine performance as will. there are two fine character actors in this film. robert prosky (who was so good in thief) plays the bear and g. d. spradlin plays general durrell.", "a movie about discipline, the lords of discipline is the wrong title to what could have been a great movie. david keith stars in a taps like movie where a coming of age drama turns into a thriller. some interesting characters, that end up not going anywhere, the movie has a plot but no real story that drives the audience to keep watching. issues of race and equality take a back seat to the overall story of discipline. military schools are looked upon as either a wrong idea run by the wrong people, or the only real justice left. these questions are not answered as david keith tries to lead his cast. instead, a nice movie, but far from anything great. much like david keith's performance, the movie falls short of anything timeless.", "the book was quite good in terms of writing. the movie was very mediocre. however, people need to keep in mind that the book was a fiction novel. that the movie was not based on a true story. that at the citadel an upperclassman is forbidden to even touch a lower classmen. that the book is a standing joke among the cadets there and the movie is a laughing stock. to compare the events of this movie to reality shows very poor taste. please keep this in perspective before comparing the book to today's military or military academies. the only place where the walk of shame is still practiced is at the virginia military institute and there only for honor violations (lying, cheating, stealing, or encouraging another to do so).that being said, the book was an excellent novel and the movie was okay. (even if i object to the light it cast on american military institutions) i was able to relate to some of the characters and situations (though i had to snicker at certain parts)"]}

a-list directors standing in line to work with her is celebrated for her willingness to help new writer-directors by lending her name to attract finance and her presence on set to attract audiences. this can, of course, prove embarrassing - josie balasko's first directorial effort sac de noeuds didn't exactly set the screen alight but huppert was right to see the promise which has since been kept over and over - but on the other hand it can result in something as delightful as aleandra leclerc's les soeurs fachees (huppert has a new film with leclerc, les mediaturs, in post-production even as we speak). she got it right this time, too, with joachim lafosse who probably wouldn't have got this one off the ground without huppert. real-life brothers jeremie and yannick renier play huppert's twin sons who live with her in what was the family home til huppert divorced their father patrick descamps, who has remarried and lives within driving distance with his new wife and child. the french title nue propriete, is more specific, a french legal term in which a family member, usually an ex-spouse, is allowed to live in a house but has no legal right to ownership so that they cannot, for example, sell it or take in lodgers. this, in fact is the position in which huppert finds herself and as it happens she does want to sell, move away with a neighbour/lover and open a b&b. this brings us to the twins, neither of whom appears to have any friends although one has a girl he uses as a sex-object. long before we, the audience, enter the scene, the boys have become dominant, especially jeremie renier who thinks nothing of interrogating his mother daily, verbally abusing her and going through her bag. it goes without saying that her attempt to introduce her lover to the twins is a disaster. this is a cloistered, unhealthy family with huppert thinking nothing of taking a shower openly whilst one son cleans his teeth two or three feet away; a great deal of screen time is given over to meals, traditionally a time when families come together in harmony but not, of course, here. as usual huppert gives a master-class in screen acting but there isn't really a bad performance throughout. it's not exactly feelgood but it is a fine film and worth anyone's time.", "nue propriete isabelle huppert. she was the only reason why i selected to see this movie. she is a brilliant actress and provides such a natural relief by her screen presence. she has got those tricks up her sleeve to glue audience's attention on her  always! the story is about a divorced mother- played obviously by isabelle; and her two sons  thierry (ill-tempered) and francios (sensitive) who live together and the special relationship they share. when the mother wants to sell the house to start a new life with her lover jan (kris cuppens), thierry is one who apposes the move and this results in dividing the family and a touching ending.the director  joachim lafosse has also written the story and this is just his fourth movie as a director, yet he shows class. i think the forte of joachim is the drama woven around his characters. the director lets all the characters in the movie let loose, relaxed and all characters give an astounding real performance. i think each character's brief stands out on its own with crucial expressions and emotions; and at times we feel like missing on one expression while seeing the other. i obviously was always hooked on isabelle's acting talent.all the actors have played their role with punctual brief, but the show is stolen with a very good acting done by jeremie renier playing thierry. he shows the vulnerability and childish temperament with ease.i would like to mention a special scene that is brilliant in the movie - when jeremie is hiding in the bush, with the camera focused on him, and the hazy background running the actual scene  all taken in one shot. i think this was a true winner shot of the movie.go and see the movie, you will enjoy it.(stars 7 out of 10)", "this movie tells the story of a family collapsing on its own equilibrium. the director chooses a series of very essential and meaningful scenes and we seldom see close ups. the camera is almost always fixed in one point, and this gives the viewer the sensation of being a hidden witness to the events. real life brothers jérémie and yannick renier play 2 twin brothers that couldn't be more different. one is instinctive, passionate, ill-tempered and self-confident, while the other is more sensitive, shy and withdrawn. their divorced mother is played by a brilliant isabelle huppert, and is experiencing a second wind in her life and believes that her sons are pinning her down. when she decides to sell their house to start a new life with her lover, tension rises and the family bursts apart. lafosse has proved to have talent as a director. i give it a 6/10.", "while \"private property\" can be loosely brought under the umbrella of \"dysfunctional family drama\" (a recent good one, in the english language, is \"the squid and the whale\")  divorced single mother, emotionally immature just-turned-adult sons, the family's lacking in general purpose and direction  it probes the psychology of the protagonist in a way more subtle than you would find in hollywood.the plot and events are not important here, just anchors for character development. while the twin sons are just turning adult, the mother, pascale, who has been working as an employee wants to start her own business elsewhere, with a modest b&b operation. the pre-requisite for her dream is selling their house, which meets immediately with objections from the sons, tierry and francois. the divorced father lives within driving distance, with his own family now, but is still on good terms with the sons, something the mother loathes. the mother is having her second romance, seeing a neighbour regularly. tierry has a girlfriend, not a serious relationship. there you have all the characters. nothing much happens. as i said, the events serve only to anchor the depiction of relationships between the various people. at the end, something does happen, an accident which is left open-ended.the movie starts in a mood that you can almost call jovial, as the sons tease pascale for her new dress. we see a lot of the family in a mundane daily activity  eating at the kitchen table. it's only upon reflection that it occurs to me that these scenes perhaps underscore the dependence of the sons on their mother, as do the scenes that repeatedly remind us that they often need a ride from the mother as they live in a remote location and their motorcycle is not a reliable piece of machinery. the message finally sinks in that although tierry and francois have just attained adulthood, they are still children in more ways than one. sitting in front of the tv seems to be their major activity, particularly after pascale has left the house to stay temporarily with a girl friend after a quarrel with tierry. the pair become very much like the little kid in \"home alone\" (but less resourceful).the distinction between the tow sons also unfolds gradually, but very clearly. tierry is the rebellious one with an explosive temper while francois is introvert, shy and more caring for his mother. there is surprisingly little sibling rivalry, despite their regular fight for the motorbike and adolescence jealousy from tierry when his girlfriend receives a little attention from francois. the more significant thing, however, is that despite the obvious fact that francois is pascale's favourite, tierry does not seem to be jealous, probably because he does not care enough about his mother to be so disposed.the file is shot in a simple, straight forward style, using mostly a static camera, with average-length scenes  a day-to-day story told in a simple manner, the way it should be. consistent with this, and apt, is the decision of not having any background music, until the ending 3 minutes (which in itself is quite interesting because the powerful, overwhelming and disturbing strings would be consider by some as an unnecessary distraction but by others as a brilliant coda to the emotion-charged conclusion).playing tierry is jeremie renier who had a similar (but less explosive) role in last year's cannes winner \"l'enfant\", demonstrating that he is a top choice for playing a young man facing a huge mental obstacle, however caused, in attaining maturity. yannick renier, his real brother, turns in an appropriately subdued, gentle persona. but it is of course isabelle huppert, as one poster points out, that is the main attraction for most viewers buying a ticket, including this one. all that i can say is no matter what role she has been given, huppert always brings to it something that makes it more memorable.", "the french film, \"private property,\" sets up a fierce battle of wills between a divorced mother and the two ne'er-do-well sons (fraternal twins) who still live with her. pascale wants to sell the house and open up a bed-and-breakfast with her new boyfriend, but the young men, fearing the loss of the property that they believe should rightly go to them, attempt to block any efforts in that direction.with intelligent direction by joachim lafosse and incisive writing by lafosse and francois pirot, this low-keyed family drama explores the complexities inherent in filial, sibling and marital relationships. the confrontation scenes, many of which take place during meal times (come to think of it, i don't believe i've seen this much eating in a film since \"babette's feast\"), are sharply drawn and effectively staged. the acting is excellent across the board, particularly that of isabelle huppert, as the middle-aged woman determined to finally start living for herself, and jeremy renier, as the more belligerent and self-centered of her two sons. yannick renier, jeremy's brother in real life, is also very good as the more passive of the twins.some viewers may feel let down and frustrated by the inconclusive ending, but i enjoyed the ambiguity of it. we have been made privy to just one brief episode in the lives of these people - then it's time for us to move on.", "joachim lafosse's 'private property' portrays a family scarred by divorce. the mother, pascale (isabelle huppert), lives with her two sons, thierry and francois (real-life brothers jeremie and yannick reniere), in an isolated rural household. though they are both young men, the brothers come across as puerile layabouts. thierry is an indolent student and francois is employed only in odd jobs around the house; much of their time is spent on ping-pong, computer games and playing around on francois's bike. the two subject their mother to teasing and taunting that is on one level playful and amusing but on another level disrespectful and mean; this is apparent in the very first scene, where pascale's new lingerie is the impetus for hurtful ridicule.pascale is stoical in the face of such barefaced disrespect, but we can clearly see that the mother-son relationship is extremely strained. although the two brothers depend on pascale for food and transport in their isolated household, they show her very little respect. at the same time, pascale is suffocated by the continued dependency of her unappreciative sons; she has had to put her aspirations on hold in order to look after them. the furious encounter between pascale and luc, her ex-husband, played out before the two boys, is an early intimation of the divisions in the household; thierry and francois are visibly distressed by the argument between their absentee father and their struggling mother.pascale's only outlet is her secretive relationship with jan, her neighbour. when she and jan hatch a plan to open a bed and breakfast, she finally decides to assert herself, putting herself first after 15 years of raising her children on her own. the brothers are dismayed by this plan, which will involve the sale of the house to finance the new business. thierry stridently denounces her plan as fanciful and angrily proclaims his and francois's sole right to inherit the house. when pascale invites jan over to dinner with the boys he tries to reason with them about their mother's rights to the house, but this only exacerbates the problem. this is one of many scenes set at the dinner table, which becomes less and less a focus for the family and more and more a theatre of conflict. thierry's taunting soon turns into persistent bullying about the rights to the property and pascale eventually quits the household and retreats to the home of a friend.with isabelle huppert away from the screen, the film loses some of its magnetism, but the conflict that emerges between the two brothers soon becomes engrossing. francois increasingly regrets the absence of his mother; his resentment towards thierry comes to a head when he humiliates him in front of his girlfriend. a violent argument ensues, resulting in a terrible accident. the following scenes are all the more gripping as we see the panic on the faces of the family members but do not know how serious the accident is.the conclusion of 'private property' is one of the most powerful pieces of cinema that i have seen this year. thierry's belief that his mother has caused all the family's problems, past and present, is brought into the light of day. pascale and luc are left to pick up the broken pieces of their family. as the sole piece of music in the entire film begins

huppert ever talked into participating in it?a middle-aged divorcée resides with her grown sons somewhere in the dreariest reaches of belgium. every day that is chronicled features an overcast sky, morose characters and a setting outdone in gloominess only by that day's script. when the closing credits mercifully make their appearance, they're accompanied by the only music in the soundtrack: a

self-hating walloon. does it matter?avoid his product.", "in my opinion, \"nue propriete\" contains universal images which create a dramatic tension that is never absent from the film. there is, thank goodness, no comic relief to detract from the dire positions of the characters. also, there are no mindless subplots which cause the characters to wander off in aimless directions. the most obvious classical theme, some would say biblical theme, is that of cain and abel, with thierry as cain. a modern reflection of oedipius rex is very obvious. alas, poor thierry is also somewhat like hamlet, especially with hamlet's insult of gertrude in shakespeare's bedroom scene, where the female parent is accosted by a barrage of language befitting a brothel. the thierry-hamlet image is manifest in the relation between thierry and his girl friend, as with hamlet and ophelia. thierry's hatred is also aimed toward jan, his mother's new partner, much like hamlet's dislike for his new father claudius. pascale, the mother in the film, reminds one of nora in ibsen's a doll house. both women want out. the acting in \"nue propriete\" is very good, the direction is a above average. this film

captures more about the relationships between modern youth and their baby-boomer parents than a dozen sociological tracts or studies could ever hope to achieve. on one level, the two sons are simply over-indulged, self-pitying and foul-mouthed brats, but that is far from the whole story. they are victims too, of a society in which self-fulfillment trumps parental duty and parents think that they can buy the loyalty and affection of their children with money and material goods. not that this family is especially prosperous - in fact, they live an essentially hand to mouth existence, but still enjoy most of the fruits of modern western culture - motorbikes, video games, etc. isabelle huppert is terrific as the long-suffering mother who is unable to confront her own children for fear of alienating them completely, so much so that she has to recruit a surrogate in an attempt to break through to them. although the film is set in france the chords it strikes are universal. it makes you angry, frustrated and occasionally just overwhelmed - much like being parent of teenage boys.", "in his first film \"nue propriété\"/\"private property\" belgian director joachim lafosse films the

(unimportant, but funny that the word \"holt\" means dead in hungarian which is my first language.) this movie is like a therapy, an advice for unhappy, lonely people. a believable film is a great pleasure nowadays, but if you meet your own life face-to-face in a script, well... it's pretty scary. if you pay attention good enough, it changes your life! thank god for this film!", "william hurt is one of my favourite actors. steady, brooding, sensitive. unfortunately, the mix of loneliness, poignancy and longing for love is obscured by oft ill-judged caricatured characters and situations.i've read through the other reviews as well as seen the movie twice, now. there is no doubt that men such as graham holt do exist, sitting in the wings of society. far more commonly, their (early, in his case) midlife crises emerge as they find life is slipping by and one that will have true meaning - and legacy. \"i want you to look after me when i'm old\", he blubs to the boy, james as they fight and argue.whilst the media has us all believe that only inner city kids with hoodies and a drug dependence are the only ones who have grave emotional issues. so far, we're ok. the intention is good and the intense interactions work well as well as the temper tantrums performed by both man and boy.i noticed that many reviewers who wrote glowing comments may be a little overwhelmed by our english \"quaintness\". or supposed quaintness. i really don't want to sound patronising. we certainly hold onto unrepresentative views of the u.s. thus, this film's sedate pace may have an added attraction for them. that, though isn't my issue - it's the likes of jane horrock's vulgar and totally unsuitable character, social worker debbie and the overplaying of keith allen's part as the boy's father. i've had issue with social services myself and i can only think that the writer david cook and director chris menges felt that the film needed 'spicing up'. a sardonic character often works and occasionally makes a film, but only if it works.i really don't wish to insult his film further - but that old chestnut that the critics usually end up with springs to mind - would make a great tv movie. a pretty good, one though.", "this film was not exactly what i expected, although to tell the truth not even i know for sure what i was expecting from it. the idea is interesting: a middle-aged man named graham (portrayed by william hurt) who gets interested in a boy named james and decides to adopt him. however, their relationship is very turbulent. the boy often has sudden fury attacks, which (as you can guess and understand) takes graham to despair. even when the boy finally begins to get along well with him, there comes a time when he suddenly changes again... although later the boy demonstrates that he's human by hugging graham when he cries. the ending is apparently happy - they seem to end up together.the film's got some good moments when graham and jamie get along fine and is also a nice attempt on this very difficult relationship. it has some gorgeous cinematography as well, thanks to the magnificent sunsets and the nature sceneries.william hurt's acting as graham is good, perhaps his best performance on pair with his professor hobby in 'a.i.: artificial intelligence'. a very cute nathan yapp portrays well a young james (as jimmy) and chris cleary miles portrays well the disturbed james some years older.", "paul wrote a beautiful review with the proper amount of reverence towards what is in our culture almost a sacred subject, the father son relationship. this is the story of two such relationships, each one gone bad, and how the two survivors find the solution in each other and could find the solution in nobody else. the filmmakers also had a problem which needed a solution and found that in the cinematography, direction and marvelous acting and casting (several actors for each character at different ages) and music you'll remember long after the lights go up. because it's such a small scale picture i would only give it a 9/10 and benhur and laurence of arabia get a 10, yet they're no better, only bigger.", "i am not a father yet, but i understand how the main character feels like here. and it is a feeling that goes throughout the movie. which also manifests itself in the title. william hurt is an amazing actor and his skills are needed in this very slow paced drama, that deals with a lot of things and traumas.and while i could dig it to a degree, i'm not sure what the thresshold for other viewers is. that is up to you to decide. a strange movie then, that almost feels a bit niche in its structure and its approach. not for everyone for sure, but very well made.", "this is an exquisitely poignant tale of a love-starved, troubled orphan boy and an emotionally incomplete man who has decided to reach out for what he wants most in life: a son. jamie very much wants to love the kind man who wants to adopt him but is prevented from doing so by the promise he made to his biological father just before dad went to jail: to love him \"best in the whole world forever.\" in what may just be the greatest dramatic performance by a child ever captured on film (surpassing even that of freddie bartholomew in \"captains courageous\" who had held that title for that past 60 years), chris cleary miles demonstrates a precocity which makes one wonder if he hasn't already overcome some great tribulation(s?) in his short life in order to give such a compelling performance. alternately masochistic, loving, violent and affectionate, the range and depth of emotion he portrays are nonpareil. i am still having trouble believing it was only a movie! it is unfortunate that miles never acted in another movie; on the other hand, when you start at the top you can only go down.others have called this william hurt's greatest role and i would have to agree. while his transformation from the stiff, detached loner to loving father was beautifully written in the book by david cook, hurt interprets this flawlessly. in fact you might say the film's brilliance was relatively easy on the heels of cook's depictions. nevertheless every scene in the movie is significant and the editing with the multiple flashbacks was excellent. why this film did not win all kinds of awards is beyond me.\"second best\" is second best to none in its genre.", "william hurt plays a present-day bachelor-postman in his 40s, living a lonely life in a welsh village, who wants to adopt a 10-year-old boy. is he a pervert? no, he just wants to do father-and-son things, like fishing and camping. i haven't a clue as to what this movie is trying to say...and i feel even more helpless trying to summarize its plot. the tough little kid he's matched with temporarily is a mercurial tyke who seems to want to manipulate hurt and exploit his open heart--but for what purpose? (if it's for personal gain, he's going about it the wrong way). director chris menges, working from a screenplay by david cook, adapting his novel, gets very fine work from his star, but the picture is a curious one, melodramatic and somewhat off-putting. the story's main themes--childhood vs. adulthood, rebelliousness vs. allowing yourself to be loved--cover familiar territory, while chris cleary miles as the lad (despite being a natural child performer) is stuck with impossible scenes such as breaking a window and screaming at hurt, \"the honeymoon's over!\" john hurt is very funny in a brief supporting bit, but alan cumming is unintentionally villainous and theatrical as an adoption caseworker. menges fiddles around with camera tricks and other artistic flourishes that wouldn't have been necessary had he been given a script with clearer intentions. despite all this, hurt's performance as a man who desires to be a good father is touching and expressive, but it isn't enough to save the picture. ** from ****", "david cook, author of the novel of the same title and also involved in the film, is known for his sensitive and probing treatments of characters marginalized in society. after seeing the film, i made a point of searching for the book, and at long last spotted a \"galley proof edition\" in a used bookstore in oxford. the picture is faithful to the novel-- if anything, excessively so. much dialogue is reproduced intact. a number of small incidents and gestures which seem inconsequential or puzzling in the movie were revealed as symbols or evocations of episodes which the book had fleshed out. directors themselves so immersed in every detail are at risk of assuming too much understanding from the audience, depriving them of just another few words, or a brief camera close-up, which would have put a point across coherently. but these are quibbles, for there is enough depth and quiet eloquence left here to call for a rare ten stars out of ten.this is the story of an unlikely relationship which succeeds as the mutual balm for unusual wounds. the man graham and the boy jamie both suffer profoundly from separation from their fathers-- physical separation in jamie's case (his adored dad is in prison), emotional in graham's. each discovers that the other cherishes the memory of just a few days of filial closeness, shattered shards of supreme bliss sparkling in the dismal landscape of their emotional lives. yet not only does graham, a candidate to adopt jamie, lack the primary qualification for a stepfather: a wife. he is a shy nerd with no obvious charisma whatsoever for a hyperactive, street-wise, cynical kid.but traumas in his past have stamped this boy with a vehement misogyny. as little as he fancies anyone presuming to take his father's place, he craves having a stepmother even less. graham's bachelorhood is a relative advantage. graham proves himself gradually with humility, honesty, and a quality of unfailing respect for the person struggling underneath jamie's sullenness which one can only describe as reverence. a \"special-ed\" teacher of my acquaintance called jamie (and chris cleary miles' passionate characterization) very realistic, and pronounced graham (as brought to life masterfully by william hurt) \"a genius\" in his approach to the developing relationship.while some will complain that this film drags, others will value its quiet atmosphere in which heart-codes are patiently decrypted. the more important the dialogue is, the likelier it is to approach whispers. one crucial central scene, barely audible, as the haunting strains of the score's \"rift\" theme echo away more faintly still, never to be heard again, must be one of the tenderest moments ever captured on celluloid.perhaps graham has been plagued by a touch of agoraphobia. the cinematography deftly suggests this world view: interiors of small rooms, fussy wallpaper, obtrusive props, brilliant curtains covering the windows; exteriors somehow painting scenes of ravishing beauty with brushstrokes of vague terror.graham holt is an unlikely hero, but a true one. if more people treated one another the way he does, the world would be a better place.", "if you have a sense of love within you, this movie is for you. there are few things as sad as loneliness. and few things as heart wrenching as seeing it overcome.this film provides both. though it was not a huge success in the theater, (this film was gravely underrated), it is a wonderful story. a bond of trust and love between child and adult, forged in the pain and fear of emptiness. if you missed it in the theater, take the time to find it, and watch it at home.i can only hope that a long awaited dvd release is near at hand. there are too many movies with 'created' story lines. this one is as real as it comes. if only there were more like it...... an update... here in 2012, this has still not been released on dvd. what a shame. i watched it on laser disc yesterday, and it is such a wonderful film. someone missed the boat on the dvd release. sad...", "i rarely write reviews for movies. and having seen the other excellent reviews, mine is hardly needed. but i stumbled across this movie and felt i had to comment on it.this is an excellent movie with wonderful acting, directing, writing, screen play, and filming. i saw the last 2/3 of the movie by accident and could not tear myself away from it.william hurt and the boy actor (sorry - forgot the name) are thrown together by life's accidents and develop bonds for one another. the rough edges on each character are worn smooth as each accommodates the other and learns of the other's trials and humanity. the acting is superb and rarely gets in the way of the content - more to the point, the acting complements the story well.but what makes the movie special is the character development. the writing, directing, and screen play successfully convey the existential experiences of the actors as they develop and react to one another.a good song, a good poem, a good book - are made special if they are accessible - if they evoke within you the ring of truth and personal history. this movie communicated with me extremely well on a personal basis, on many plans at the same time. every element of this film was well crafted. the movie is cerebral and touching - with very few rough edges. i couldn't recommend it more highly for an adult audience.", "second best is a touching and moving masterpiece directed by chris menges . the plot reminded me of another great british movie  \"dear frankie \".i guess it is that father  son relationship that makes movies like these two so special. the loyalty of the son both in the characters of jimmy played by nathan yapp and graham holt (william hurt) is touching and i am not ashamed to admit that there were moments of this movie which truly brought tears to my eyes.one other reviewer wrote: \"chris cleary miles' apparently initial screen performance as the troubled youth is near amazing.\" and i just couldn't agree more with that  the acting of chris cleary miles, william hurt and for that matter all the other actors in this movie is first class  their gestures, the words they say , the way they say them  you just have to watch it to experience the movie  because that is what you are going to get an unforgettable experience.the flashbacks moments (the memories of the little jimmy) were very careful chosen and i felt really weird watching them , knowing that there is something more hidden out there this feeling stayed with me until the final scenes in which these flashbacks became more revealing there is also a lot of symbolism is second best the scene in which the boy looks at the man who wants to adopt him trough a broken window is just one example and if you watch it more than once you will sure notice many other symbols  the letter, the scars ... etc you just couldn't watch the movie without noticing how much the music contributes to it  piano or guitars, it fits the scenes really good - making the emotional impact they have on the viewer's powerful and overwhelming.", "i've read the other reviews posted here and concur with all of them. the film triumphs in its realistic depiction of two broken hearts, jamie's and graham's. i think, in order to appreciate the story, one must have somehow experienced the psychic shock of childhood abandonment, either emotionally or by outright physical abandonment. the pleasure of watching this film, aside from the acting and cinematography, is having the sense that it will work out okay. at the very end, when jamie walks briskly to catch up with graham, slips his hand into the grownup's hand, and then walks much more slowly, one can see in their stride together the fulfillment each has received. i rewound the film at that point to see that scene again.", "when this grown man finds himself alone, mechanical,bereft of feeling in his middle age,comfortable yet empty, he 'happens\" upon a picture of a little boy who is up for adoption among many in a window as he passes by.while he is in the position to provide the material things,security and home to the child in distress, the boy,although himself a derelict on the sea of life, still can feel and has felt the pangs and deep love and hurt of life unlike the man, and from this hard earned deep emotional well he is able to provide his new father a far more substantial quid pro quo.both william hurt and chris leary miles prove that their talent is not only acting, but in readily tapping into the old souls that they are.both reflect the author' david cook's every nuance ,every glimpse of the needful souls they portray .chris plays the part masterfully, both of a cunning fox, but a vulnerable damaged untrusting soul, who despite his past is just waiting to show love and be loved if given the chance, with no strings attached once is guard is gingerly taken down.a warm heart in trade for a warm hearth.a great piece of artistry in it's purest sense, both the book and the movie,which faithfully mirrors it.james hagerty, westminster,maryland", "happened past this on cable, and was instantly hooked. chriscleary miles is an exceptional young actor, and i eagerly awaithis next performance. william hurt turns in his usualoutstanding performance as well. overall, a touching andultimately uplifting piece.", "excellent film. both the boy (yapp) and hurt were great. seemed real life like. hurt the lonely man, and the boy as one needing love. it highlighted the struggles both and to go through before they could finally come together as father and son. also the musical track is great.", "william hurt is very believable as a west country postmaster and the adoption process is taken apart in a sympathetic and believable manner. the film has charm and pace while dealing with a difficult subject. if it were to be made now would there be a different emphasis in the light of current obsessions with protecting children from paedophiles?", "i know there are not many reviews, but i recommend this one.the boy who plays the child is so good that i looked him up and he doesn't seem to have been in any other films.william hurt also does a good job of playing a middle-aged man who has aged well.i wonder what a real parent and child are.no matter how much the world hates his father, he is the only father in the world who is related to him by blood.the main character tries to be a \"nurturing parent\" with such a boy, gradually coming to understand him.i cried at the end.", "a different perspective on kids growing up without parents. willing hurt plays a wannabe father who's still that kid deep down and nathan yapp plays a kid who's mature for his age but troubled inside. it's a slow paced, interesting story. director chris menges portrays emotions perfectly with simplicity. it's hard to imagine a film like this getting a cinema release in the 2010s, not least with a hollywood actor. small-scale & intimate, it's the kind of story we'd now see expanded to six episodes & shown on tv. hurt is very good in the role of a painfully shy & inarticulate man, who in his efforts to adopt a child from a troubled background, finds a way of understanding the traumatic relationship with his own father.", "i fondly watch movies like this. did not read the book, but the movie , characters and the dialogue delivery is remarkable. life happens, situations are weird, human life is complex and the lessons of life are in these very fine details of experiences. i understand some reviews which are not so much in favor, but it is truth for some! breaks the stereotype that being married, having own children and taking generations forward is the only socially acceptable way of life. truth is, there are people out there dealing with unique circumstances and singled out. this move is about a lonely man and lonely child coming together to write a father and son story of their own. and i appreciate the depiction, esp. the child actor and the psychology he adopted absolutely fantastically. and afcourse the complex, mature and growing character of the child jimmy is just great. there is so much inside of the boy, and the artist played it really well. i like the movie , the story and the fine details displayed. it is just an awesome , authentic experience watching the movie.", "second best is a nice film that can be emotionally tough to watch at times when the young boy has his tantrums. it stars well known actor william hurt and a young boy actor. these two actors are the main characters in the film. william hurt was known for his romantic roles in his early films but this is a different role for him. he looks very different in his role as a postmaster with his glasses but you can recognise his ginger hair. this is a good study of life in a post office and dealing with troubled relationships. the setting of the film can be mistook for ireland but no, it's actually filmed in wales. it's a nice setting. a scottish actor from bond film goldeneye and julie walters are also in this film. it has a very nice music tune to listen to played at the end of the film.", "william hurt is an interesting actor. although he has made many money making hollywood films, he seems to enjoy also making small artistic films that must

they seem to end up together.the film's got some good moments when graham and jamie get along fine and is also a nice attempt on this very difficult relationship. it has some gorgeous cinematography as well, thanks to the magnificent sunsets and the nature sceneries.william hurt's acting as graham is good, perhaps his best performance on pair with his professor hobby in 'a.i.: artificial intelligence'. a very cute nathan yapp portrays well a young james (as jimmy) and chris cleary miles portrays well the disturbed james some years older.", "paul wrote a beautiful review with the proper amount of reverence towards what is in our culture almost a sacred subject, the father son relationship. this is the story of two such relationships, each one gone bad, and how the two survivors find the solution in each other and could find the solution in nobody else. the filmmakers also had a problem which needed a solution and found that in the cinematography, direction and marvelous acting and casting (several actors for each character at different ages) and music you'll remember long after the lights go up. because it's such a small scale picture i would only give it a 9/10 and benhur and laurence of arabia get a 10, yet they're no better, only bigger.", "i am not a father yet, but i understand how the main character feels like here. and it is a feeling that goes throughout the movie. which also manifests itself in the title. william hurt is an amazing actor and his skills are needed in this very slow paced drama, that deals with a lot of things and traumas.and while i could dig it to a degree, i'm not sure what the thresshold for other viewers is. that is up to you to decide. a strange movie then, that almost feels a bit niche in its structure and its approach. not for everyone for sure, but very well made.", "this is an exquisitely poignant tale of a love-starved, troubled orphan boy and an emotionally incomplete man who has decided to reach out for what he wants most in life: a son. jamie very much wants to love the kind man who wants to adopt him but is prevented from doing so by the promise he made to his biological father just before dad went to jail: to love him \"best in the whole world forever.\" in what may just be the greatest dramatic performance by a child ever captured on film (surpassing even that of freddie bartholomew in \"captains courageous\" who had held that title for that past 60 years), chris cleary miles demonstrates a precocity which makes one wonder if he hasn't already overcome some great tribulation(s?) in his short life in order to give such a compelling performance. alternately masochistic, loving, violent and affectionate, the range and depth of emotion he portrays are nonpareil. i am still having trouble believing it was only a movie! it is unfortunate that miles never acted in another movie; on the other hand, when you start at the top you can only go down.others have called this william hurt's greatest role and i would have to agree. while his transformation from the stiff, detached loner to loving father was beautifully written in the book by david cook, hurt interprets this flawlessly. in fact you might say the film's brilliance was relatively easy on the heels of cook's depictions. nevertheless every scene in the movie is significant and the editing with the multiple flashbacks was excellent. why this film did not win all kinds of awards is beyond me.\"second best\" is second best to none in its genre.", "william hurt plays a present-day bachelor-postman in his 40s, living a lonely life in a welsh village, who wants to adopt a 10-year-old boy. is he a pervert? no, he just wants to do father-and-son things, like fishing and camping. i haven't a clue as to what this movie is trying to say...and i feel even more helpless trying to summarize its plot. the tough little kid he's matched with temporarily is a mercurial tyke who seems to want to manipulate hurt and exploit his open heart--but for what purpose? (if it's for personal gain, he's going about it the wrong way). director chris menges, working from a screenplay by david cook, adapting his novel, gets very fine work from his star, but the picture is a curious one, melodramatic and somewhat off-putting. the story's main themes--childhood vs. adulthood, rebelliousness vs. allowing yourself to be loved--cover familiar territory, while chris cleary miles as the lad (despite being a natural child performer) is stuck with impossible scenes such as breaking a window and screaming at hurt, \"the honeymoon's over!\" john hurt is very funny in a brief supporting bit, but alan cumming is unintentionally villainous and theatrical as an adoption caseworker. menges fiddles around with camera tricks and other artistic flourishes that wouldn't have been necessary had he been given a script with clearer intentions. despite all this, hurt's performance as a man who desires to be a good father is touching and expressive, but it isn't enough to save the picture. ** from ****", "david cook, author of the novel of the same title and also involved in the film, is known for his sensitive and probing treatments of characters marginalized in society. after seeing the film, i made a point of searching for the book, and at long last spotted a \"galley proof edition\" in a used bookstore in oxford. the picture is faithful to the novel-- if anything, excessively so. much dialogue is reproduced intact. a number of small incidents and gestures which seem inconsequential or puzzling in the movie were revealed as symbols or evocations of episodes which the book had fleshed out. directors themselves so immersed in every detail are at risk of assuming too much understanding from the audience, depriving them of just another few words, or a brief camera close-up, which would have put a point across coherently. but these are quibbles, for there is enough depth and quiet eloquence left here to call for a rare ten stars out of ten.this is the story of an unlikely relationship which succeeds as the mutual balm for unusual wounds. the man graham and the boy jamie both suffer profoundly from separation from their fathers-- physical separation in jamie's case (his adored dad is in prison), emotional in graham's. each discovers that the other cherishes the memory of just a few days of filial closeness, shattered shards of supreme bliss sparkling in the dismal landscape of their emotional lives. yet not only does graham, a candidate to adopt jamie, lack the primary qualification for a stepfather: a wife. he is a shy nerd with no obvious charisma whatsoever for a hyperactive, street-wise, cynical kid.but traumas in his past have stamped this boy with a vehement misogyny. as little as he fancies anyone presuming to take his father's place, he craves having a stepmother even less. graham's bachelorhood is a relative advantage. graham proves himself gradually with humility, honesty, and a quality of unfailing respect for the person struggling underneath jamie's sullenness which one can only describe as reverence. a \"special-ed\" teacher of my acquaintance called jamie (and chris cleary miles' passionate characterization) very realistic, and pronounced graham (as brought to life masterfully by william hurt) \"a genius\" in his approach to the developing relationship.while some will complain that this film drags, others will value its quiet atmosphere in which heart-codes are patiently decrypted. the more important the dialogue is, the likelier it is to approach whispers. one crucial central scene, barely audible, as the haunting strains of the score's \"rift\" theme echo away more faintly still, never to be heard again, must be one of the tenderest moments ever captured on celluloid.perhaps graham has been plagued by a touch of agoraphobia. the cinematography deftly suggests this world view: interiors of small rooms, fussy wallpaper, obtrusive props, brilliant curtains covering the windows; exteriors somehow painting scenes of ravishing beauty with brushstrokes of vague terror.graham holt is an unlikely hero, but a true one. if more people treated one another the way he does, the world would be a better place.", "if you have a sense of love within you, this movie is for you. there are few things as sad as loneliness. and few things as heart wrenching as seeing it overcome.this film provides both. though it was not a huge success in the theater, (this film was gravely underrated), it is a wonderful story. a bond of trust and love between child and adult, forged in the pain and fear of emptiness. if you missed it in the theater, take the time to find it, and watch it at home.i can only hope that a long awaited dvd release is near at hand. there are too many movies with 'created' story lines. this one is as real as it comes. if only there were more like it...... an update... here in 2012, this has still not been released on dvd. what a shame. i watched it on laser disc yesterday, and it is such a wonderful film. someone missed the boat on the dvd release. sad...", "i rarely write reviews for movies. and having seen the other excellent reviews, mine is hardly needed. but i stumbled across this movie and felt i had to comment on it.this is an excellent movie with wonderful acting, directing, writing, screen play, and filming. i saw the last 2/3 of the movie by accident and could not tear myself away from it.william hurt and the boy actor (sorry - forgot the name) are thrown together by life's accidents and develop bonds for one another. the rough edges on each character are worn smooth as each accommodates the other and learns of the other's trials and humanity. the acting is superb and rarely gets in the way of the content - more to the point, the acting complements the story well.but what makes the movie special is the character development. the writing, directing, and screen play successfully convey the existential experiences of the actors as they develop and react to one another.a good song, a good poem, a good book - are made special if they are accessible - if they evoke within you the ring of truth and personal history. this movie communicated with me extremely well on a personal basis, on many plans at the same time. every element of this film was well crafted. the movie is cerebral and touching - with very few rough edges. i couldn't recommend it more highly for an adult audience.", "second best is a touching and moving masterpiece directed by chris menges . the plot reminded me of another great british movie  \"dear frankie \".i guess it is that father  son relationship that makes movies like these two so special. the loyalty of the son both in the characters of jimmy played by nathan yapp and graham holt (william hurt) is touching and i am not ashamed to admit that there were moments of this movie which truly brought tears to my eyes.one other reviewer wrote: \"chris cleary miles' apparently initial screen performance as the troubled youth is near amazing.\" and i just couldn't agree more with that  the acting of chris cleary miles, william hurt and for that matter all the other actors in this movie is first class  their gestures, the words they say , the way they say them  you just have to watch it to experience the movie  because that is what you are going to get an unforgettable experience.the flashbacks moments (the memories of the little jimmy) were very careful chosen and i felt really weird watching them , knowing that there is something more hidden out there this feeling stayed with me until the final scenes in which these flashbacks became more revealing there is also a lot of symbolism is second best the scene in which the boy looks at the man who wants to adopt him trough a broken window is just one example and if you watch it more than once you will sure notice many other symbols  the letter, the scars ... etc you just couldn't watch the movie without noticing how much the music contributes to it  piano or guitars, it fits the scenes really good - making the emotional impact they have on the viewer's powerful and overwhelming.", "i've read the other reviews posted here and concur with all of them. the film triumphs in its realistic depiction of two broken hearts, jamie's and graham's. i think, in order to appreciate the story, one must have somehow experienced the psychic shock of childhood abandonment, either emotionally or by outright physical abandonment. the pleasure of watching this film, aside from the acting and cinematography, is having the sense that it will work out okay. at the very end, when jamie walks briskly to catch up with graham, slips his hand into the grownup's hand, and then walks much more slowly, one can see in their stride together the fulfillment each has received. i rewound the film at that point to see that scene again.", "when this grown man finds himself alone, mechanical,bereft of feeling in his middle age,comfortable yet empty, he 'happens\" upon a picture of a little boy who is up for adoption among many in a window as he passes by.while he is in the position to provide the material things,security and home to the child in distress, the boy,although himself a derelict on the sea of life, still can feel and has felt the pangs and deep love and hurt of life unlike the man, and from this hard earned deep emotional well he is able to provide his new father a far more substantial quid pro quo.both william hurt and chris leary miles prove that their talent is not only acting, but in readily tapping into the old souls that they are.both reflect the author' david cook's every nuance ,every glimpse of the needful souls they portray .chris plays the part masterfully, both of a cunning fox, but a vulnerable damaged untrusting soul, who despite his past is just waiting to show love and be loved if given the chance, with no strings attached once is guard is gingerly taken down.a warm heart in trade for a warm hearth.a great piece of artistry in it's purest sense, both the book and the movie,which faithfully mirrors it.james hagerty, westminster,maryland", "happened past this on cable, and was instantly hooked. chriscleary miles is an exceptional young actor, and i eagerly awaithis next performance. william hurt turns in his usualoutstanding performance as well. overall, a touching andultimately uplifting piece.", "excellent film. both the boy (yapp) and hurt were great. seemed real life like. hurt the lonely man, and the boy as one needing love. it highlighted the struggles both and to go through before they could finally come together as father and son. also the musical track is great.", "william hurt is very believable as a west country postmaster and the adoption process is taken apart in a sympathetic and believable manner. the film has charm and pace while dealing with a difficult subject. if it were to be made now would there be a different emphasis in the light of current obsessions with protecting children from paedophiles?", "i know there are not many reviews, but i recommend this one.the boy who plays the child is so good that i looked him up and he doesn't seem to have been in any other films.william hurt also does a good job of playing a middle-aged man who has aged well.i wonder what a real parent and child are.no matter how much the world hates his father, he is the only father in the world who is related to him by blood.the main character tries to be a \"nurturing parent\" with such a boy, gradually coming to understand him.i cried at the end.", "a different perspective on kids growing up without parents. willing hurt plays a wannabe father who's still that kid deep down and nathan yapp plays a kid who's mature for his age but troubled inside. it's a slow paced, interesting story. director chris menges portrays emotions perfectly with simplicity. it's hard to imagine a film like this getting a cinema release in the 2010s, not least with a hollywood actor. small-scale & intimate, it's the kind of story we'd now see expanded to six episodes & shown on tv. hurt is very good in the role of a painfully shy & inarticulate man, who in his efforts to adopt a child from a troubled background, finds a way of understanding the traumatic relationship with his own father.", "i fondly watch movies like this. did not read the book, but the movie , characters and the dialogue delivery is remarkable. life happens, situations are weird, human life is complex and the lessons of life are in these very fine details of experiences. i understand some reviews which are not so much in favor, but it is truth for some! breaks the stereotype that being married, having own children and taking generations forward is the only socially acceptable way of life. truth is, there are people out there dealing with unique circumstances and singled out. this move is about a lonely man and lonely child coming together to write a father and son story of their own. and i appreciate the depiction, esp. the child actor and the psychology he adopted absolutely fantastically. and afcourse the complex, mature and growing character of the child jimmy is just great. there is so much inside of the boy, and the artist played it really well. i like the movie , the story and the fine details displayed. it is just an awesome , authentic experience watching the movie."]}

["compared to previous attempts by competing studios to break disney's stranglehold on the animated film market, the swan princess really is a good movie. the animation does not quite have disney's finesse and got a little rough in places, but was still watchable and generally pleasing to the eye, unlike, say, thumbelina. the songs, though not particularly memorable and vaguely cheesy in the manner of much older animated flicks, did not bring the movie to a grinding halt and actually managed to, in general, help it along. it has a plot.that's not to say that the swan princess doesn't have its problems, mostly in its characters. the titular lead, princess odette, is a flat failure as a heroine--she never *does* anything except lead her one true love, prince derrick, to her--and even then, she only does that because her animal friends, puffin, speed the turtle, and jean-bob the frog, cook up the plan for her.derrick is much more likeable, and though throughout most of the movie he is a flaming idiot, he is a likeable and sympathetic flaming idiot--and he does learn. his mistakes are, as a rule, human and understandable, and in the end it is he who saves the day and finally learns the movie's apparent lesson--that beauty is not all there is in matters of love or anything else.the development of their relationship is refreshing--rather than falling in love at first sight, they start out hating each other with a passion, and it takes them years--spanned capably over the course of one amusing if sugary song--to realize that they do love each other. and then derrick blows it(!), and spends the rest of the movie scrambling to recover from his mistake.the end battle was satisfying, though in general i prefer for the heroine to help save their hides in some manner. the movie-makers were not afraid to beat the living daylights out of their hero, and though the save he pulls in the end is nothing short of miraculous, it was at least shown much earlier to be within his princely capabilities.despite its flaws, i found the swan princess to be a satisfying and re-watchable movie--though i did catch myself agreeing with derrick's comment (stated early in the movie) that he could do much better.", "it's been a little while since i had seen \"the swan princess,\" but i could distinctly recall many scenes from it. i'd always enjoyed it before, so i decided to watch it again - for the most part, it still holds up.of course, it's a children's tale, so some slack must be given; it's not going to be as well-rounded (entertainment-wise) as a movie like \"toy story,\" but it does contain its fair share of adult-oriented jokes along with silly physical humor that will amuse children.the story is pretty basic - a lovely princess is destined to marry a prince, but an evil sorcerer (voiced by the diabolical jack palance) has other plans and kills the princess' father, locks the daughter away and casts a spell on her so that she turns into a swan at night.it's predictable, but it's got a great vocal cast, and the animation is pretty good. give it a shot. avoid the unnecessary cash-in sequel.", "i happen to think that this was a very cute fantasy movie. it does not copy the swan lake and it is original. however, it has some good love scenes and i liked it in the sense that it was very fun to watch. i still remember the movie from when i've seen it years ago. it has pretty good animation and good songs to remember. the music is nice to listen to. the characters are displayed well and the voices are clear. this movie is adorable. i liked it very much and it was memorable. there are two sequels following it that i enjoyed as well. the third one was very funny. anyways, the swan princess was satisfying. this is a great movie to show to kids and adults.", "prince derek and princess odette are forced to spend their summers together by their widowed parents hoping for them to fall in love. just when they seem to do just that, derek says \"you're beautiful.\", and odette ask \"what else?\". derek could only reply \"what else is there?\". evil sorcerer lord rothbart kidnaps odette and places her under a spell which turns her into a swan. she turns back to a woman when she's on the lake as the moon rise. when moonlight leaves the lake, she's turn back into a swan. the only way to break the spell is to have her love make a vow of everlasting love.this is very much an 80s style animation with the singing, the drawing, and the subject matter. all the characters are straight out of 80s disney movies. and quite frankly, it works on that terms. the animation, the jokes, the princess subject, the songs... all of it works but only on that term.", "it's hard to see an animated feature and not compare it to some of disney's best. hey disney did pioneer the concept, perfected it, and did what not many companies could do: do it well.this movie didn't do it well, although richard rich (the director) did once work for disney, he directed \"fox and the hound\" and \"the black cauldron\"- with the latter being one of disney's bigger disappointments. ten years later, he directed \"the swan princess\" even after disney tried to convince him to stop production as they were planning to release a version of their own, but when he wouldn't scrap his, they scrapped theirs, and in 1994, disney had it's biggest box office gross ever with the lion king, the swan princess brought in about 9 million in the us (disney re-releasing the lion king at the same time was a little dirty on disney's part- but it may have saved a lot of parents from having to sit through a bland disney wannabe)the animation is the films best asset, brightly colored, smooth, no gimmicks or massive special effects. the characters on the other hand, could've used a little retooling, they lack much, if any existed, of a personality. princess odette, in an attempt to put her in the head strong, faith in herself disney heroines of the early 90's, fails to do so. when princess odette and prince derrick meet as adults, they are completely smittne with each other, he tells her she's beautiful, to which she asks \"is beauty all the that matters?\" and he asks \"what else is there?\" we are supposed to believe that this is no ordinary princess, she's smart, sophisticated, and yearns for more than just being a beautiful face, which would be alright except that up to that point, they couldn't stand each other, and then when placed in a room together, they stare at each other, and are in love- so didn't she just fall in love with what she saw? they never really seemed to be into each other's personalities before, so doesn't that just leave aesthitcs? true, the prince's response isn't exactly, well good doesn't begin to cover it, the princess is being hypocritical.the story isn't the worst, but has a few plot holes, one of which would make the ending completely unnecessary, but would leave out the generic fairy tale battle between the prince and a large creature.the only other saving grace are odette's animal friends - speed the turtle, jean bob the frog (john cleese with a cheesy french accent), and puffin- the puffin(?). jean bob's ongoing attempts to get a kiss form odette to break his spell (he believes he is actually a prince that was turned into a frog) are actually interesting- too bad the rest of the movie isn't.the saddest thing about the whole movie is it's blatant ripping off of a disney score. the songs throughout the movie are often very similar to the songs in beauty and the beast, but unlike beauty and the beast, the songs aren't exactly catchy, let alone good. the only decent piece of music is the love song \"far longer than forever\" sung by prince derrick and odette (whose singing voice is also that of anastasia's, kiara in disney's lion king ii, and princess jasmine in the 2nd and 3rd aladdin films) but even it doesn't compare to anything from the disney songbook- the title of the song itself has a cheeseboard romance sound to it. this one would've been much better as a straight to video release, and compared to some of disney's straight to video flicks does help it look slightly better, but only slightlyoverall, kids will enjoy it, the animation is beautiful and lush, but parents may want to leave the room.my recommendation, pop in beauty and the beast or the little mermaid- head strong princesses, people under magic spells that change their appearance, great music that you don't mind getting stuck in your head, well developed stories, well developed characters.", "after disney released \"the lion king\" which has been met with critical praise and became a success at the box office for the company, disney animator richard rich (known for directing \"the fox and the hound\" and \"the black cauldron\") teams up with new line cinema to make their very first animated feature, \"the swan princess\", based on the swan lake ballet.it tells the story about two kids named derek & odette who started to hate each other for about a long time until one day, as young adults, they finally realize that they do love each other, but derek ruins the wedding by saying \"what else is there?\" and they will never see each other again. meanwhile, an evil sorcerer named rothbart captures odette and turns her into a swan that would only turn her back into a human as the moon rises. as derek tries to find odette by learning from his mistake, odette and her animal friends jean-bob, a frog, speed, a turtle, and puffin, a bird attempts to bring her back to derek.i first saw this film when i was a child and it has been stuck with me ever since even as a young adult (i'm turning 19 soon, by the way). it still holds up, but there are two problems that i do have with this classic. the animation is beautiful and colorful, but is a bit deflated some of the time. derek is a bland character, but is a somewhat sympathetic character since he learned that to love a woman is to prove his love for her.flaws aside, everything else still holds up. the story is very original and sticks closely to the ballet without any ballet dances which works for me. the characters are charming and likable; odette is a beautiful and feisty character and i liked her hair as well. the side characters including bromley, rogers (whose line \"how to offend women in 5 syllables or less made me laugh) and uberta, who never fails to steal every scene in the movie. the animal sidekicks including jean-bob, speed, and puffin are excellent. the villain rothbart, voiced by the late jack palace, is great and his motives, although over-the-top, are very amusing. the songs, on the whole, are pleasant and memorable to listen to especially \"far longer than forever\". even the ending is satisfying. the battle between derek and rothbart is the best highlight of the movie because it represents some of the past-disney films with a style and tone to it.overall, the swan princess isn't a masterpiece, but it's by no means a cult classic that has been stuck with me since my childhood. it may have received a mixed reception when it was first released, but i'm recommending this to those who love disney and non-disney films.", "i think it was very interesting. this is one of those films that should've been part of disney as a good help and part of the walt disney animation cannon.i believed that odette can be part of the official disney princesses since she had a great role in the film. and for rothbart, he may not be as strong as maleficent, but can be very powerful that he was so close to being one of the primary villains.", "i recently dug out a bunch of dvds from my childhood which includes the swan princess.the plot is pretty interesting and i definitely felt like it was a good story, but i felt like the characters were dull which made it less enjoyable. for example, bromley shows up at random moments and his character isn't developed much.i've never seen the movie sequels, so perhaps the characters are developed more and are less dull in the sequels, but i did hear the sequels are quite bad and this one's probably the best one out of the swan princess movie hellhole. this is pretty good for a knockoff disney movie, but i felt like the characters weren't very enjoyable.", "this movie came out when i was two, and no matter how much time passes nor how many times i rewatch it throughout the years, i still love the swan princess. can it be a bit corny? yes. is odette a bit dull for a heroine? yes. could the plot have been solved within 10 minutes if derek (or odette) was a bit smarter or william a bit less vague in his final moments? yes. but then is the music fun to listen to, the characters enjoyable and the experience memorable? yes!the animation is not as great as disney, but it isn't hard to overlook because the film is good overall. speaking from a feminist side, i do wish odette had a rounder personality and more drive to save herself instead of waiting for derek to find her. while she did plot to get the map and lead derek to her, she did it after puffin and her friends worked her up to it. before puffin arrived, she was seemingly content to spend the evenings moping to jean-bob and speed about her curse and how she needed derek to save her from it and then spent her days pouting on the lake. you've got wings, baby -- use them!derek isn't the smartest person in the movie, but you gotta love him for his drive and his self-awareness, knowing he was an idiot who said the wrong thing. it was also refreshing to see the hero actually be physically capable of the rescue. the plot nicely demonstrates his talent as an archer so we are able to believe the incredible save at the end.the movie also has memorable lines that i've jokingly quoted throughout my life. it's an all-around fun movie. don't take too much stock in the people, but remember the lesson -- love is more important than beauty.speaking of love, the other piece this movie has going for it is the relationship development that trumps its disney competitors. this isn't love at first sight! this is a slow growing love after years of being forced together that first bred distain before love ever thought to bloom. it was wonderful to watch two people actually know each other from child to young adult instead of two young adults meeting for the very first time and boom, it's love! one of the best parts of this movie.tl;dr: this movie is one of the classic greats. it's worth a spot in anyone's personal collection.", "the plot is as follows once upon time in generic there lived a king who very much wanted a child. one day he got one a daughter and decided to marry her off to the son of the old widow queen uberta. but when the day comes the princess is cursed by an evil sorcerer and transformed to a swan it's up to the prince to save her.the plot. the plot is stolen from disney movies most notably sleeping beauty but this movie is way way way worse than that masterpiece. the plot is not bad just bland and uninteresting.the characters. the ones that aren't stolen from other animated movies are dull. derk is a nonentity and odette is nice but dull. the villain's your ordinary power hungry magician . the only one that has some life is the queen who is fun and entertaining the voice work is good from the likes pontus gustafson(the jungle book) , lars edström(professor calculus in tintin) and torsten wahlund( the seacrow island movies) nothing great but good. it's well done and i have nothing to complain about .the stand out being christina schollin as the queen..the song . the song are a mixed bag some move the plot along like \"no fear while some grind it to a halt like far longer than forever. no more mr. nice guy is fun but pointless and the actor(swedish voice) is not really a singer.all in all the swan princess is not bad. but it's dull ,lifeless, pointless and very cliché.if you have kids there are far far far worse thing to put on ( most made in sweden). but they are also much better things to show them the film is mediocre.", "i recently watched the animated swan princess film , and while it had some redeeming qualities, it failed to leave a lasting impression on me overall. the animation was decent, featuring some impressive scenes, but the plot felt lacking and predictable, leaving me disappointed. the characters were also forgettable and needed more real depth, making it difficult to become invested in their journey. the film failed to create a solid emotional connection with the audience, an essential aspect of any successful movie. on a positive note, the soundtrack was enjoyable and had some catchy songs that helped elevate the viewing experience. while it's not terrible, it's not a standout animated film and offers nothing particularly memorable compared to other movies in the genre.", "i was 9 when the movie first got released. i loved it so much. as an adult i decided to watch it again. as usual, i now know what my kid years was like. man, was i easily amused. :d although it is still a very cute movie for little kids. more for the girls really. but there are some funny moments for the adults. the animation is pretty decent. it's not \"beauty and the beast\" or \"lion king\". in fact, you shouldn't expect too much. but i wouldn't mind watching this film with my little cousins. that's pretty much it. as an adult i'd stay away from it. as for the kids, they will definitely enjoy this.6/10", "i have always loved the voice of jack palance, which is as distinctive and rich as those of richard burton, george clooney, and sean connery. the film is richer for the brilliant casting of palance's voice.i was viewing the movie with my daughter and my reasons for enjoying the film were the brilliant lines spoken by the male characters that could have been from one of those film-noir gangster films of the fifties. the turtle character reminded me of peter lorre's voice. take some of the lines: \"once you steal something, you spend your whole life fighting to keep it,\" or \"you should write a book: how to offend women in five syllables or less.\" these are lines that adults will love not kids. the dialogue: \"don't let her die!\" \"is that a threat?\" \"don't you dare let her die!\" \"oh, it is a threat\" could have been straight out of a modern gangster film..the lines/dialogues, not the screenplay, are top notch. the film is not great cinema but provides reasonable entertainment for both young and old.", "i really remember liking this movie as a kid. i mostly remember loving the main characters friends the most, mainly the animals. they made for great comedy. of course when i was younger i loved anything animated, so the real question is \"will i still like this when i'm older?\" well it had been a long time since i watched it but i did end up remembering it and wanted to see it again. to my surprise it still for the most part held up. sure in my opinion now the songs are pretty corny but being a kid i know that would make me love it more back in the day. seems like the only animated songs that i still like come from the disney movies, don't know why. the story itself i still consider good. the movie as a whole i still find really fun and wouldn't mind seeing it again in a few years or so.funny thing is i always wondered what company made this movie. i knew it wasn't disney and i wondered if it was don bluth. well now i know and it wont bother me anymore. :)", "when i was little, i watched this movie over and over. i loved it so much, i even bought the sequel (the second sequel, no, but the first i did like). i absolutely adored it. when i hit 10 or 12, i sort of forgot about it.so, yesterday, bored out of my skull, i decided, what the heck? i dug out the old vhs copy and stuck it in the vcr. i honestly only remembered something about a princess being cursed and her being in love with a prince, but i did remember that i loved it.but when i watched it last night, i cringed in parts. the animation bothered me, it was so bad. i mean, what was up with odette's hair? honestly. and the story/songs were a bit cheesy.don't get me wrong. i'm a big fan of disney-and-disney-style movies for kids. and maybe i'm being too harsh - after all, there have been worse movies. (have you seen some of the barbie movies? i rest my case.) all i'm saying is that as a kid, i loved this. i wasn't distracted by the fact that all odette did was cry over derek, or that derek was a complete dumb@##. it was just a pretty story.now that i'm older, however, it's a slightly different story.", "i have the vhs for this which is 16 years old and i always watch it whenever there is nothing on tv.the film is about a beautiful princess named odette who falls in love with a handsome prince named derek whom she met as a kid and the two of them don't get along at first but as they are brought together every summer they fall in love with each other.of course when odette gets older an evil warlock wants her from himself and when she refuses to marry him as he is taking over her kingdom every time the moon goes she is magically transformed into a swan and when the moon comes back the next day she is turned back into a human again.although its kinda silly in a way and a bit old-fashioned but i like this film for a very long time as it was fun,cute,romantic and sweet. the songs were so sweet like for longer than forever was such a romantic ballad and that other song no more mr nice guy which had me smiling for days. the characters were colorful,the plot was nice and cheerful,the ending was nice.if you like transformation movies like beauty & the beast,brother bear,the little mermaid then check it out.8/10", "first time watching it, instantly drawn my attention. huge fan of 2d animations as it was a big part of my childhood. the sound scores, effect and original songs/lyrics were outstanding and very reminiscence of disney princess movies which i adore so much. amazing voice castings and fit entirely well with the tone and the characters itself. narrator was terrific in just those seconds, the vip for me were definitely odette & derek due to their very compelling voice acting and movements. jean-bob, puffin, brom and speed were great side characters for comedic release from both sides. great villain and somewhat original to this movie alone. plot wise something similar with other classic disney princesses movie, same formula but slight differences in world building and characterisation. started very strong but flunked as it progress, weak final acf. it was very overly dramatic, fun, entertaining with groovy songs & great handrawn smooth motions. highly recommended.", "the swan princess sure is a childhood favourite of mine, even in my mid 20's. i still hum the songs and miss the times when hand-drawn animation was the thing. no movie has ever captured me the same way as this one. i can't pretend it's a masterpiece, because its story structure needed tightening up a bit to make it more flowing, but i just can't help loving its simple premise.our main characters, derek and odette, are set to spent every summer together from their childhood up to their young adulthood and that is not easy, because they despise each other! how they tease each other during a montage accompagnied by the wonderful song \"this is my idea\" is really entertaining, and honestly not that far from reality, because this is how many kids act in their childhood. it was spot on and arguably the strongest part of the movie.but to be honest, the fact that derek is so bad at expressing his feelings to odette is kind of a letdown after all those years' setting up of their romance. now he must prove his love for odette while the villainous rothbart has abducted her and tries to force her to marry him instead so he can get to the throne initially not using destructive methods. quite original use of the evil power hungry sorcerer villain, actually. despicably trying legal methods to get to his goal.therefore he turns her into a swan and asks her every night to marry him if she wants to become fully human again, but she only wants her true love, derek. jack palance's performance as rothbart is creepy. he talks to odette the same way a narcissist would talk and he really enjoys seeing her cry. but odette stands up to him and with her wonderful animal friends try to escape his grip when he is not around.and with that conflict set up we get all sorts of things you'd expect from this kind of fairy tale.like briefly stated in the beginning of my review, i think i like it so much, because it is so down to the basics of what i know as a fairy tale with princes and princesses, magic and of course a happy ending where good triumphs over evil. and despite the rather rushed romance, the tale of ever lasting love just speaks to my sentimental side. it's sweet, and i just can't help feeling it every time. the music is well composed and the songs are effective in conveying whatever emotion they resemble and move the story forward. and the end is perfect, gets me every time!and no matter which side you're on, it must be addressed that the swan princess, despite its flaws, has earned its place in animation history as the last theatrically released western animated movie to not use any aid of computers. after the invention of the caps system to digitally colour the drawings and the release of disney's the rescuers down under it has been standard procedure using that method sadly making ink and paint hopelessly ineffecient and a thing of the past seen from a business standpoint.so to sum up, the swan princess is an enjoyable casual fairy tale for kids with animation as traditional as its premise reminding us of the good old times of hand-drawn disney spiced up with good songs, entertaining characters and a creepy villain. in my opinion it should have been a stand-alone movie, because richard rich and co. has ruined it with unwanted forced garbage cgi sequels with stupid plots, impossible settings, awful songs and obnoxious characters. stick with this one and preserve the real magic.", "to be honest, i did find this movie to be overall just \"cute.\" the story needs some work for pacing purposes and such. the songs...um...well, nothing i found all that memorable. they did try to add to the story, but they were a tad on the grating side, so i only half watched during these scenes.i enjoyed the sidekicks the best, really. often, sidekicks take away too much from the leads, but i think the trio in this film (speed, puffin and jean-bob) could have used more airtime. especially speed. i love steven wright's comedy and he puts his deadpan humor into the turtle well. but, he gets only a handful of lines. 5 maybe?the sidekicks seemed to be more thought out characters than odette and derek. also, the movie seems to need a swift boost of pace before they make their debut on screen, in my opinion. from there, the story seems much more focused and much more fun to watch. maybe odette should have met these critters when she was a little kid. :)", "literally watch this movie for rogers and the villain. rogers is hilarious and is fun to watch his make passive aggressive lines and the villain is just an idiot and it's great. the plot itself is kinda weird and i feel like some characters are knock off disney but it's fun nonetheless.", "*sigh* i was like around 2 years old when it came out and apparently it was a favorite of mine along with the disney classics and such. and even though i'm 13 now.. i still love it. a total classic love story where the two \"lovers\" are separated and the prince has to find the princess. i love the songs 'this is my idea' and 'far longer than forever'. this is my idea is probably my favorite because it shows odette and derek grow up together and it's quite funny when they come to the \"this is not my idea.. this isn't my idea.. of fun\" since it usually concludes humorous scenes. any young child would love it.. especially girls. the animal-trio are hilarious especially jean-bob and speed.", "some decent animation, but not much else worthwhile. it seems like they rushed the characters and the story in the first 15 minutes and then realized they still had over an hour and had to fill it somehow. odette and derek actually seem interesting when they're kids, but are cardboard cutouts for the rest of the film. songs are not memorable. a lot of pointless slapstick. the villain's plans make no sense (if he could change into a beast and attack the king, why didn't he do that from the start? changing odette into a swan isn't even necessary). odette wants to know what derek likes about her besides her beauty and he can't think of anything. and that's a pretty accurate assessment of the whole film.", "\"swan princess\" isn't all that good. it isn't all that bad either, though. it's what i call a nice movie. the songs are nice, nothing you'll be humming for weeks afterward, but passable. the story is nice, though blantantly borrowed from \"swan lake\". i guess there's some way we have to make these ballets more accessible to kids, though. the character voices and the animation are nice, not necessarily outstanding, but good enough. this is very much a middle of the road movie to me.one final note, though. howard mcgillin, the voice of prince derek, is currently playing the phantom of the opera on broadway. he's very good.", "i believe this movie was a waste of time. it's not a bad movie on itself and the animation is not bad either...the problem is that it is based on swan lake. however it has nothing that resembles that (except the swan). it's an insult to remove that beautiful music by tchaikovski and put disney-like songs! it's awful! the characters look like a bunch of silly teens and the story is more funny than it should be. well, it's a cartoon for kids but this doesn't mean that it has to be silly. no kid has ever been harmed by drama. it's swan lake not nightmare on elm street! i suggest you better skip this one and watch the other animated movie instead. it's simply titled \"swan lake\".", "horribly written cliché disney type characters drawn poorly with unimaginative, repetitive and annoying songs..this swan lays an egg. i expect some folks to disagree, but really, what a complete waste of time. i watched it for the first time on netflix last night and was upset i hadn't seen it in the theater to have the satisfaction of walking out in a tiff. although the movie had some \"all star\" cast members lending their talents to this film, they couldn't help the garbage \"insta-script\" that i am sure was created by the writers in about 15 minutes to try to cash in in the resurgence of disney mania that was rampant in the 90's", "this was my favorite sage of movies when i was 3. i still love them to this day when i am 15. this movie tells the timeless tale of two lovers who are drawn apart by one shallow prince who eventually learns that there is more to love than looks and beauty. when derek goes on his quest to find odette, he realizes how much he really does love her and his kingdom gets sick of hearing about here. the music is spectacular as well. i love the songs \"far longer than forever\" and \"this is my idea\". \"this is my idea\" shows derek and odette growing up and you notice that every year their relationship grows until one summer when they realize how much they really do love each other. when they are pulled apart by rothbart and how shallow derek is, they sing the duet \"far longer than forever\" about their everlasting love for each other. anyone who does not like even the first movie has a real issue. even though the saga got kind of lame as the years went by, they still hit me close to home.", "i have seen so many animated movies from different studios and i must say i'm a huge fan of this genre. but this is obviously the worst i've ever seen. poor script and visual directing, awful sound effect and character voicing, no artistic elements, and not to mention terrible music... this movie came out in 1994 and i can see that at that time disney was at the top of the animated film market and was the only studio to have had a long history of making this type of film, while others were just beginning, this may partly explain why new line cinema did a terrible job on this movie. but seriously, richard rich, the director, had had directed a few movies for disney before and they're good ones, not this bad!i gave this movie 3 stars out of 10 because that's all i think it deserves.", "i'm sorry, but when studios other than disney or dreamworks try to make an animated movie, they sometimes bomb the moment they step into the theater. only 20th century fox has had a minimal success in the 'toon business, what with anastasia and titan a.e., but even those films didn't make a lot of money. the swan princess is a waste of time because it's basically a half-hearted rip of beauty and the beast. let's see, mystical castle? check. fairy tale creatures? check. magical sub-plot? check! lovey-dovey ballads paired with wacky and humorous songs for the kids? check! for the love of god check! the songs are extremely extraneous because the lyrics sound just like dialogue that occasionally rhymes. it sounds like a bunch of actors reading the script set to a barely audible tune. oh, and about those fairy tale sidekicks...there are three of them. is that necessary? three?! there's a french frog named, get this, jean-paul (ha!), a turtle named speed (um, how ironic) and finally a puffin named...wait for it...puffin. *sigh* there really isn't a story here, because most of the sequences feel like padding, particularly the scene where the royal orchestra dresses up as animals and let prince derek shoot arrows at them. and it's set to music!! if one thing could be said about the swan princess it's that it is way, waaay better than any of it's wretch-inducing dtv sequels. please, please do not watch these even if you're overly bored and catch one on toon disney. it's not worth it. instead, rent anastasia, titan a.e., the iron giant, or any one of a hundred better disney competitors. at least anastasia only had one freakin' sidekick, and that was just a bat who didn't talk much.", "if you're planning on watching this movie, watch at your own risk, because it is *painful* to sit through. the film involves a vengeful wizard who curses a princess to exist as a swan by day until her prince declares his undying love, which is the blandest story line i've ever heard of. the plot is generic. the characters are bland. the main character looks exactly like aurora from sleeping beauty. and the songs are insipid. the voice acting straight up sucks. by all means, stay as far away from this movie as humanly possible.", "i will always love this movie. the romance and chemistry between the two main characters are great! i love how sweet and simple it is and i love the animation in it and it looks like a real fairy tale. the music and songs in this movie are so great as well. i love that we get to see the characters as children and then grow into adults. this movie will always be a part of my childhood.", "i remember being 8 years old and watching this movie endlessly. i also recall singing \"for longer than forever\" over and over again (i'm such a sucker for that kind of songs). recently, i had been trying to recall the song unsuccessfully, and when i found it on netflix, i jumped in for old time's sake and because i wanted to hear the song.watching it 12 years later resulted in disappointment regarding the plot line, character development, animation, voice acting and lyrics. that may seem to imply i hated it, but i didn't. it is actually more than the sum of it's parts, mostly, i think, because it follows the formula of every princess movie that ever existed, and that worked out.i also think something that really saves this movie is the sidekick ensemble. jean bob + speed work very well together and are a lot of fun. puffin is very likable. bromley and rogers are a very fun companion to prince derek, and both villains are indeed very entertaining. the scenes containing these are very fun.music-wise, it is also very formulaic, borrowing incredibly from beauty and the beast (in my opinion). it works, though. i think the ideas for the songs were very clever, although the execution was not very well done. for longer than forever is good. not great, but you will find yourself humming it every once in a while.i think children will enjoy this, and if you take it lightheartedly, you will like it too. i also noticed this is a good movie for watching over and over and over... it's easy to switch in and out, and works well being played on the background. i really understand why i loved this as a child.", "out of the richard rich animations, this is definitely the best. here's why. i was hugely disappointed in the king and i, and black cauldron failed on character development. swan princess is an excellent movie, that is much better than the above titles. the weakest character was derek, he was a bit of a drip, whereas odette is a feisty and beautiful character, and i actually loved her hair. the voice cast is highly commendable- jack palance came alive in a positively booming way with the character of lord rothbart, who is a great villain and john clesse is sidesplittingly funny as jean bob. there are some really funny lines \"you should write a book...how to offend women in 5 syllables or less.\"(jean bob and rodgers get the best of them) can i also say, that this is one of the few animations that makes excellent use of the evil-sorcerer-back-for-revenge formula? the animation is actually not as bad as most people say, a bit deflated at times, but very nice mostly with some pretty colours and the songs are sweet and memorable especially far longer than forever. this is my idea is a long song but also catchy and is a good look at how derek and odette went to hating each other to loving. i also absolutely loved the incidental music, and the ending is satisfying. other than that, it is so worth watching! 8/10. bethany cox", "this movie, about a power-hungry sorcerer who curses a princess to live as a swan by day in this tale of everlasting love, is a weak animation movie.it certainly has good animation, colors and score and songs with some nice and funny scenes and moments. however, it struggles with its character development, storyline and some other elements. the movie rushes sometimes where we don't get enough time to get to know the characters, especially one of the protagonists, princess odette. the story is predictable and has a few plot holes and weird takes, which doesn't let us be tested. that's also for the script because it isn't exactly the best one i've experienced. the movie also relies heavily on filler scenes and moments that are unnecessary long as well, even though some parts are funny. so overall, it really has a potential, but it needs major improvements.while this movie possesses appealing visuals and engaging music, its character development and storyline falter. the rushed narrative and predictable plot fail to fully engage, while the underdeveloped characters hinder their emotional connection. despite its potential, the movie requires significant improvements in these areas to fully captivate.", "imagine if a disney animated movie mated with a saturday morning show - this is what their offspring would look like. the songs really suck, though at least they tried to write them in ways that would advance the story, unlike the stop-the-story-to-a-halt disney songs. animation and backgrounds lack polish, and look more saturday morning than feature-film. the characters - ha! movie looks like it was severely edited down; if not, it certainly feels like it was, then narration added. take a look at the first 10 or so minutes for the best example.", "look at what they did back in time when not much of computer assisted magic available as it is today, they did an excellent job. talented voice artists, talented real voice artists, not just bunch of talkative kids voiced the persona. technical aspects are as superb as they could get to the date's standards. beautiful songs and orchestrations, and very talented vocalists too. my child enjoyed watching this same as i did. i continue listening to the beautiful songs of this movie every now and then. very nice.", "not sure why the other reviews are so generous. this movie is just bad. straight to video would have been too generous.the characters are immediately forgettable, and there are too many of them to build any backstory.the soundtrack and songs are just bad. the movie would be better without them.prepare yourself to never care about the main characters struggle or love story. the only character with enough backstory and character complexity to even bond with is the villain.the plot is full of holes. the consequences of the \"curse\" change several times during the movie.the best part of this move is that it ends at some point. blows my mind that there were sequels.", "this film was one of the highlights of my childhood. as a young girl i was captivated and mesmerized.would strongly recommend this to anyone. the songs are catchy, the characters are extremely relatable and likable. film conveys an important message of in inner beauty, teaching the prince to look at women for more than what's on the outside.the film has a easily followed and excitably dynamic plot line, while predictable, the ending is well done and succeeds in pleasing the audience.the color pallet is also aesthetically pleasing and altered throughout the film to suit the current mood of the characters and the constantly adapting circumstances. i also loved the animators transitions and development of the characters physically, the princess grows to be incredibly beautiful and as a child i was captivated by her beauty, hair and lovely white dress.", "i am not really sure what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this animation film. this poor animation film did not make any real sense at all and did not have any real direction at all which made this animation film even more difficult to watch. the storyline of this animation film was awful and bad and basic and poor and simple and straightforward and weak. the cast selection could have been a whole lot better and stronger. they did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. there was not any sign of real chemistry at all throughout this animation film between the cast members.", "i hadn't watched swan princess when i was younger but recently i did and i loved it! i think its so different from the ordinary disney film...well i heard it's not even disney so i guess that's a given. but the characters looked different and it has some really nice songs. especially the first one \"this is my idea\" which speeds things up from when they're kids to when they're older...its really cute and the song itself is nice. also its not the typical old animated films where the guy and girl fall in love straight away since they kinda dislike each other when they were young. but after that they just have this beautiful love which is both happy and sad and perfect!! other than that, far longer than forever is a great song, along with many others. tons of funny characters - jean bob the frog, puffin and speed who are odette's animal friends are hilarious as well as prince derek's adviser and his friend. anyway love it!! a must see classic.", "it's got its silly and flimsy moments, but any kids' animated film does. the difference with this one is that the humor is more sophisticated and funny, and the film wipes out the old \"fall in love in two seconds\" idea by having the kids grow up hating each other and then finally find love and question it in order to make sure their love is true and is for the right reasons. for this reason, the lovers are more believable and sympathetic than almost any other kids' movie characters.", "i saw this movie when i was very young and at first never really understood it. my uncle had just taped it for me and put it on and i sat down and watched it. as the years passed and i watched it more i understood it better. of course it makes perfect sense now considering i'm 13 but i recently watched it at my friend's house and i had to smile at all the sweet moments and at the \"far longer then forever\" song. the relationship between odette and derrik is so romantic and i love it! this movie is one of my favorites and considering it was made awhile ago the animation isn't bad. i mistake it for a disney movie a lot of the time but who can blame me? ^-^", "this was probably my favorite movie as a child i loved the way they showed them

little and still love it now as an adult. it was that movie that i could watch 100 times and still love it. it had everything you wanted from a movie, it has fantasy, mystery, action, romance, comedy, and drama. it had songs you would be singing the next day, it had unforgettable quote \"what else is there?\". the movie isn't for everyone especially people who prefer visually stunning pieces or deeper character depth. they don't go into great characterization especially of the romances, as they just seem to fall in love. showing this recently to little cousins they don't see the brilliance of the story behind the movie. i love this movie and the sequels. not for everyone but a favorite of mine.", "the swan princess when it was released on 18 november 1994 was the worst films ever made

a little corny, but its just so cute! plus, the music is fun to sing (my sis and i have formed a duet of \"this is my idea\" in which i always have to sing the guy part). jean bob is so funny in all the movies. prince derek is quite the hunk! rothbart is one of the greatest villains of all time. uberta is at her best in this one. it may sound obsessive, but we know all the lyrics to the songs

prince was annoyed by her until she came out of her \"ugly duckling\" stage and became quite stunning, thats when he fell for her but he couldn't think of the words to say except about her beauty. she left and he decided he would prove his love later on but she was taken away and he had to find her. its related to sleeping beauty also by the fact that she has animal friends that help her. the

must have been five or six. i can remember that i loved it, though. just the other day i had the opportunity of seeing it again. a good ten years have passed, and now i'm a senior in high school. yet, i still enjoyed it immensely. the whole thing had me sighing at the sheer romantic-ness of it. the medieval setting, the story--i just think it's a cute story. the beginning song was very lively, a lot of fun, and then went into a very cute love scene...i was gushing like a little girl. the songs, the plot, the humor...i loved it all. i loved the characters, too, speed was my favorite. definitely something i would share with my kids when i have kids. it's nice to watch something from your childhood like this...especially since i'm going off to college next year, i guess it added a more nostalgic view for me.", "my kids use to always watch this swan princess all day and every single day. and they still do watch it from time to time. now that they're older they find this movie really corny and cheesy. maybe it's because of the music and storyline was way too cheesy.", "the swan princess is essentially a remix of swan lake with some beautiful classic hand drawn animation and some good tunes thrown in. all the voice actors give their characters lots of personality, but liz callaway has the voice of an angel as odette. i've never heard such a clear and beautiful speaking and singing voice in my life. children and families should enjoy it.", "the swan princess was one of my favorite movies growing up, having worn the vhs out by the amount of times that i had watched it. i was very attached to the story, the characters, and the music, as well as the fact that it adapted my favorite ballet, swan lake. despite the film's negative reception and the fact the critics pan it to this day, i would say the swan princes is certainly a masterpiece that's been hidden by negativity on the part of those who don't understand it.the movie's animation is gorgeously drawn by hand with aesthetically pleasing backgrounds and charming character designs, the music is composed in such a gorgeous manner that it rivals disney (and beats modern disney bu a landslide), and the story is a beautiful tale that you'll want to watch again and again.", "i've loved this movie all my life and place it in my top 5 princess movies, alongside disney princesses. the music is great, odette is gorgeous, the side characters are cute and funny, the villain is intimidating yet charismatic, and the relationship between odette and derek is organic. it's not love at first sight, the princess is spunky and driven and kind, and derek needs to prove himself worthy of her love. a must watch for any young princess", "the swan princess is one of my favorite movies of all time. i watched my vhs copy on repeat. of course it's not perfect, but it has a very great story, believable love story, great friendship, loss, grief, magic (both good and bad), and fantastic animal friends. it has good music. it's funny. the cast is amazing. it's a great movie! it was the last fully hand animated movie ever made, and i am lucky enough to own some of the original artwork. i met and got to know one of the producers (long after it was made) and he still has a deep love for this movie. i hope more children get to see it and love it. it's a treasure. don't skip it. i've actually forced (had movie choice on a particular night) many people to watch it, and not a single person ever didn't like it. everyone has always been pleasantly surprised, loved it, and then suggested it to other friends.", "here is another childhood favourite, and it still is now that i am 27 years old. richard rich, a former disney animator, directed this underrated film; he retells the \"swan lake\" story here and there. so there is really no need for a full description.i love the princess odette. and like i said, this might seem strange to you guys, but i put her on a list i have made of my favourite movie princesses, either animated or live-action. and also, i love four of the songs from the film: \"this is my idea,\" \"far longer than forever,\" \"no fear,\" and \"princesses on parade.\" so overall, i loved this film, and it will always be one of my favourite animated films. one more thing i would like to say: i hope richard, who directed this film and the \"animated stories from the bible\" series, will direct more films, not films like \"the scarecrow.\"", "uninthanted tail that would change fairytale movies forever. she has seen it a long time ago and i'll never forget. and this movie was also not a disney movie as well.", "i wasn't a child or teenager when this movie came out. i was in my 30s and already married several years. i really enjoyed this movie, then and now.i've had the swan princess and the first two sequels on dvd for years now. i had no idea there were so many more, so now i've got to go looking for them all!i thought there was a good lesson in the original about not judging based on looks. fortunately for derek, odette didn't hold a grudge. fortunately, both still loved their parents despite their overbearing meddling while young.what really makes this a fave movie for me is the overall excellence of the various parts: the good classic animation, the costuming, the comedy, the drama, the romance, the many characters' depth of personality, and the interesting lighting and atmosphere of the scenery. the plot was good, but dragged a little sometimes. there was plenty of action to make up for it though. and jack palance was an inspired bit of voice casting.if you enjoyed the first movie, definitely watch the next two. i found they really rounded out odette's character. we don't see a lot derek, but when do we ever in a princess focused fairy tale, right?and can i just say that with the right materials, if i were a little kid and wanted to dress up as a princess, odette would be an excellent and unique choice. her dress' swan inspired details would be exquisite and recognizable if used more extensively.anyway, i think this is a lovely movie for all ages. if i had kids/grandkids i would share it with them. now my husband and i watch it together on occasion.", "ok, so \"the swan princess\" is another children's movie. when i saw it, i thought that it was really neat that john cleese provided the voice of the frog, and i later found out that jack palance (once known for \"shane\", now known for \"city slickers\") provided the voice of the villain. who would have envisioned those two plus steven wright and frank welker (fred on \"scooby-doo\" and ray on \"the real ghostbusters\") in an animated feature? it wasn't until years after i saw the movie that i found out what the source material was: while in st. petersburg, i attended a production of pyotr chaikovsky's \"swan lake\" in the mariinsky theater and realized that it was the same characters. of course, what stuck in my mind most of all was the haunting theme song. that ballet is more recently recognizable as the subject of \"black swan\" (which i haven't seen).anyway, the movie's nothing particularly special.michelle nicastro, who provided the voice of odette, was an opera singer (she died of cancer last year). howard mcgillin, who provided the voice of derek, was one of the people who played the phantom in andrew lloyd webber's \"phantom of the opera\"."]}

i really liked learning a bit, how the censor worked. and who is this real oddball director (chaykin) who uses their show home as a film location, where the lead actress begins to strip, while surrounded by a circle of little boys sitting. of course, we don't get past seeing her with her loud red bra, where what's followed is implied. the adjuster has a few strange moments, including one lesbian, feeling up another on a train in frank view of khanjian sitting across, fascinated. but none more unforgettable is obviously chaykin, beating off at koteas's window. chaykin too, has formed a weird relationship with khanjian's younger sister which provides a disturbing twist in it's end. even though koteas does his really good part, as a troubled and distressed guy, he's upstaged by chaykin who i thought rocked. his character was so intriguing, though the performance that really stuck, and it was a small part, was that of the head censor, hemblen. he was brilliant, almost beyond belief, so naturalistic, he too, providing another weird moment. with it's mini promotional poster, of elias, holding a bow and arrow (what's with that?) this was movie a movie that got my vested interested, i wasn't disappointed in any way by this movie, except, the high level sex scenes warning, the main one, where koteas is making love with one of his clients, in a teasing darkness, koteas and co, practically silhouettes. yes, it has style, is semi arousing, thought provoking, and of course, remotely original, but at the end of it, in spite of all these plusses, the adjuster, doesn't really equate to much. there just wasn't enough here, like filling to a sandwich. you walk away feeling unmoved, only that's not how you feel when you watch it. like many directors, eyogan went on to cast some of the same actors, for his better 'exotica'. definitely, still a recommended view. don't cross it off. some david lynch fans might get a buzz out of it too.", "a reflection about what makes everyone's life unique, through the story of noah's family. noah (elias koteas) is an adjuster, having sex with his customers. his wife hera watches pornographic movies for the board of censors. they live with their son simon and hera's sister in a show-flat. one day, they meet bubba (chris christie), who wants to make a movie in their house.i wish i had known about atom egoyan years ago. i only recently \"discovered\" his work, and it is generally excellent. between this and \"exotica\", i am not sure which i like more. he tells original stories, and puts elias koteas to good use... no one else seems to be able to do that, wasting him in supporting roles. (to mainstream audiences, koteas is casey jones but little else.) some of the plot confuses me, especially as it goes on, and it could use a second (or third viewing). and why not? this is the sort of picture to share with friends.", "(i can't believe the negative comments i have read on this page. i mean, sure, peoples opinions are allowed to differ- thats what makes this world so great blah blah blah etc... but this film is incredible and it would be a shame that someone would disregard renting it out on video because someone had bad-mouthed it here.)this film is set firmly in egoyan country. we have dysfunction, we have recorded media, we have beautiful shots, a wonderful score, great dialogue, fantastic use of silence (watch out for that one) and overall- you can feel an almost religious intensity beaming through the celluloid. my memory of this film consists of much more than just a plot- it is the warmth, the colours that stick with you too. one more thing... tarkovsky said that films best asset was its ability to sculpt in time. egoyans measured rhythm is hard to resist (obviously not for some people).it seems to me though, that the complaints here are not to do with the films form. of course it is well made. they have problems with the script, or at least the order of things. well, for me- the chaos and strange order of things in this film keeps it gripping- apart from the fact that you never know what is going to come next- isn't this half chaotic order a better rendition of reality than most? the content is also 'strange' and not really in keeping with 'popular taste'. so if you are easily offended, or more at home with spielberg- then please feel free to stick to him. but this is brave, sumptious, disturbing, invigorating, and beautiful territory. i was pleased to visit it.p.s. elias koteas' performance is probably one of my top five favourite performances ever, up there with takeshi kitano in bad cop and christopher walken in king of new york. stoic, tragic, he hardly puts a foot wrong.", "what a unique and challenging story to work through. the characters are so emotionally unavailable, it is nearly maddening. even after several days since i watched it, i can't stop thinking about what its purpose is. it requires a second viewing, if one is not too faint of heart. i loved it, even though i did not understand it all the first time. as a recommendation for all of egoyan's work -- if you're all about the quick fix of action-packed entertainment, look elsewhere. if you want an emotional, suspenseful piece of characterization steeped in a sort of horrid reality, well, this may just be the thing for you. it is a brain teaser. good luck to all.*there is also a charming short on the dvd for the adjuster called \"en passant\". it is worth a gander.", "i watched it right now. as always, atom egoyan has found a new topic and, as always,he gave us his specific approach to the theme. the way how camera is driven throughout the movie, gives a constant atmosphere of tension, enhanced by slow-motion frames in the movie. interesting film, otherwise i adore all his films, so it's no wonder i proclaim it as good.", "atom egoyan is an absolute genius, but i find it somewhat difficult to discuss his films as they are so complex. he seems to make the kinds of movies where you walk out of the theater after it's over and all the parts are clear in your head, but you can't quite piece them all together. but you can't help but try. sooner or later, everything falls into place, and sometimes it doesn't. either way, egoyan makes you really think about a lot of issues.\"the adjuster\" is about an insurance adjuster who helps victims of house fires get money from insurance companies. there is a really great parallel drawn between the adjuster, noah, and robin hood. he quite frequently shoots arrows with his bow at a billboard sign that says \"sherwood forest\". he is essentially taking money from the rich insurance companies and giving it to the poor victims of fires. we also have noah's voyeuristic wife hara, who is a film censor for porn flicks. she films what they censor with a video camera so that her sister can see what she does, as she has always shared everything with her sister. there is an extreme sense of bareness of the characters lives in the film. this is reinforced by the vast, open, almost desert landscape around the suburb. they own the only house in this particular suburb, and it is in fact a model house. even the books on the bookshelf inside are fake. all this seems to reinforce the lives that the characters live. this is a definite achievement from a cutting edge director.", "noah (elias koteas) is an insurance adjuster. he sleeps with ladies who suffered lost and arianne (jennifer dale) is the latest one who lost her home to fire. his wife hera (arsinée khanjian) watches movies for the board of censors and she secretly films the most brutal. they have a son with hera's sister are the only ones living in one of the model homes in an undeveloped field. tyler (don mckellar) is a new reviewer for the censors. bubba (maury chaykin) is a pornographer who's interested in noah's house. there is also a sex pervert stalker.i'm not sure what atom egoyan is trying to get at other than bring together a lot of the characters' dark side. the quest for a plot is left to the audience. it's a movie with a theme more than a story. one can really debate the point of each character and their significance. it's great to use modern sexual perversion as a launching off point but i like a story that moves more. it's a bit too slow and therefore feels repetitive with pregnant pauses. it's a movie that feels like it's saying something although i'll be damned if i know exactly what that is.", "even those who worship at the altar of egoyan would probably admit the adjuster needed a bit of, er, adjusting. the first half an hour of the film is so disjointed and gives so little information it's comical, almost like a parody of his later work. of course, this movie came before exotica and the sweet hereafter and is really only useful to those who enjoyed those films as an exercise to see where egoyan came from. and it goes to prove that no one, not egoyan, not scorsese, not spielberg, made their best pictures straight out of the gate. the adjuster has many of egoyan's signatures  explorations of photographic voyeurism, depraved sexuality, his wife  but in the adjuster he forgets to cross his ts and dot his is. the editing is particularly jarring, with little flow within scenes and jerky transitions between story lines. there are some interesting images, especially of the model home in the middle of nowhere and an interesting contrast between suburbia and the urban motel where elias koteas' character houses his clients/victims. egoyan deserves credit for pioneering this style of dreary, detached storytelling, which like it or not is truly original. of course, he is also responsible for the clones who have copied this style (last night, century hotel, the five senses) to less-than-desirable results and given canada the reputation of precious alternof---s. no, really, we're normal people who don't all have cold sex.", "this very quirky film by director atom egoyan is about an insurance adjuster noah, played by elias koteas. he is very empathetic to the victims of fires to their homes, and all of his clients end up staying in the same motel complex until their claims are settled (which never happens). a parallel story is about bubba and mimi, a rich couple who act out fantasies in public (she befriends him as he plays a sleeping derelict on the subway, she's a cheerleader for the football team-she is not a very young woman). the acting is fine, particularly bubba, who is played by maury chaykin. i've seen him in many other projects, i think he'll be familiar to you. my problem is the story is weird for weird's sake. who'd want to know these people? they are creepy, and the film becomes creepy. its cutting edge, but i wanted better character development. i felt it just didn't deliver. if you get the dvd, you'll be rewarded. included are two things which i really liked. one is the almost 20 minute film \"en passant\", starring maury chaykin and arsinee khanijan, who plays noah's wife in \"the adjuster\". it moves along at a good pace and tells a simple, but good story. the other thing is an interview with director atom egoyan. he is articulate and i found he is true to his craft. i also realized he directed the excellent \"the sweet hereafter\". i'd recommend that movie before you touch this film. but, if you see the dvd, buy it for the extras. check the film out. i didn't love it, but others here did.", "words cannot express how much i love the adjuster. it's actually been a while since i saw it, so i picked it up again, and well, fell in love with it once again. it's just that good.the cast consists of a canadian dream cast du jour: elias koteas! don mckellar! maury chaykin! arsinée khanjian! they're all dynamite here, playing some low down creepy characters here.koteas plays the titular adjuster in the movie, looking after people who've lost their houses in a fire. khanjian plays his wife, who makes a living from being a censor for the government (!!), don mckellar plays the new censor that was hired who catches on very quickly how to move up in the world. i'd rather not get into maury chayken's character if you don't mind lol all of these characters intermingle with each other. there's not a huge story to be found here, more of a character study. and what a study it is, as you find out a little more about each character with every viewing, with some mysteries yet to reveal (what was with the podiatrist?) can't recommend this movie enough. i have to say this is egoyan's crowning achievement, and i've been waiting for him to replicate it. (instead, he's been giving us crap like felicia's journey)", "first of all, this is painfully slow to watch. generally, i have no problem with slow-paced movies as long as there is something intriguing, like an exciting story, nice cinematography etc. not the case here. directing was good but this is one of the movies which should not be that slow, it's been made in an urban environment, there are no beautiful landscapes, there is no exciting story, something which could make me bear this pace. it should have been at least 15 minutes shorter.another thing : i love weird/bizarre/dream-like movies. the adjuster was something like that, but it is really flawed. imagine a david lynch movie without the warmth/brilliance/sensitivity, just way more cryptic, twisted and perverse. this was not beautiful to watch. not only twisted, in fact, it was even boring at times. too clinical and i could say cerebral, but i am not so sure because this was not some kind of brilliant movie.6 stars because actors were excellent and especially koteas : an underappreciated actor who should had a better career. furthermore, it was occasionally oddly interesting and i was curious to see where it goes. i didn't mind that it went nowhere, many great movies have no satisfying or clear ending. but even the journey which leads to this ending, was often frustrating to watch.", "early effort from director atom egoyan doesn't have the intricate sub-plots of his later movies but it does show that his penchant for stylized set pieces is not a new thing. from maury chaykin's elaborately staged sex romps for his wife to the hotel that the insured clients stay at; everything looks great but the movie itself seems sterile. elias koteas' performance sums it up best: cold and emotionless. sex plays a big role in this movie but no one enjoys it. from the movies that censor arsinée khanjian views to the \"extra\" benefits that koteas provides his clients - sex seems more a chore than anything else. even with chaykin's sex games, the excitement is more with the setup than the act itself. you know what? big deal! egoyan seems so intent on showing how detached (and boring) people can become that it is hard not to feel that way watching the movie. egoyan movies are worth watching because he really tries to make a statement but in most cases the films become exercises in making pretty pictures and in some cases, pretentiousness. this movie just misses being pretentious but it isn't very memorable either.", "this early atom egoyan film is truly the best of his movies that i have seen, and they are \"exotica\", \"felecia's journey\", \"the sweet hereafter\", \"speaking parts\" and of course \"adjuster\". egoyan has a very special gift and that is the way he tells the stories, a way that forces the characters to do things you wouldn't think they'll do, or do them in a very un-expected way. egoyan drives you into the story using all the tools included in a film director's case: beautiful, almost dreamy photography, haunting mysterious music,careful attention to movement and color. that is the case with all his films but in \"adjuster\" this unique style of his really comes to a peak. the strange story of an insurance adjuster being eaten inside by guilt and fear seems to take place in a world where morality and good are disappearing slowly, living the honest man to burn is his own hell, created by his inability to read the reality that lies before him. this is always a very good story material for films, because it allows the filmmaker an investigation of the psyche, tormented, searching, afraid and yet unable to tie all ropes together to make sense of the world. i recommend watching \"the adjuster\" and then watching it again after a day or two. if you dig movies, you will not forget this one. an exceptional experience.", "agree with the previous post.. this film is extraordinary and i'm amazed at the negative reactions here. i would rate it as my favourite film of all..it's an incredible and subtle meditation on what means to be alive, to be human, to love. to be human and to be confronted by this fragmented, alienating, disturbing modern existence .. with our lives and interactions largely filtered through technology and our experiences so far removed from those of our ancestors and those before.i was provoked and amazed by this piece of work - and i'd urge anyone who wants to be challenged to see it.james", "at the center of egoyan's dark journey into moral and materialistic devastation is elias koteas' noah, the mortal bearing the film's title, carrying its weight -- certainly delivering the goods in what must be considered his finest ninety-plus minutes on film. he never disappoints this viewer (his cameo turn as \"the kisser\" in lagravenese's living out loud was a landmark in my memory simply as a point of relief, an answered prayer).mychael danna's score and steven munro's sound design push the adjuster past the dream world threshold, unraveling it strand by strand to catch and spin in the viewer's subconscious. this is one you wont shake easily. egoyan magic.", "canadian filmmaker atom egoyan redefines the black comic satire of his earlier films ('family viewing', 'speaking parts'), but for all its dark wit and visual sophistication the effort doesn't add up to anything more than a cast of unattractive characters in search of a plot. these include, in ascending order of eccentricity: a handsome insurance agent who uses his control over the victims of catastrophe for sexual favors; his wife, a government film censor who secretly bootlegs violent porn movies for her apathetic sister; a filthy rich couple with a fetish for enacting elaborate exhibitionist fantasies; and so forth. the film is disturbing, perverse, sporadically funny, and totally original, bit also inscrutable to the point of confusion: it gives the impression of depth without clearly saying much about anything at all. egoyan is a filmmaker of obvious and distinctive talents, but he needs (once again) to build a stronger story around his strange characters.", "this is a great movie. you should watch it again. i agree that it is not one of agoyans most accessible films but there are many elements that first surfaced in adjuster that are featured prominently in his later works (exotica, calendar, sha). following on the impetus of many cutting edge directors agoyan employs plot elipses to avoid a forced resolution in both exotica and adjuster--in other words he creates interactions that are never really resolved, symbolized in the act of striptease. playing on the role of the erotic in both films, agoyan goes over the top with exotica--although i think it is a great film--falling back on the erotic material it others in a way that he subtly avoids in adjuster. the only real onscreen sex occurs while the adjuster and one of his clients talk about some of the loopholes of the insurance claims, a provocative and hilarious scene. the adjuster, you are led to believe is a pervert or something to that extent, but the truth is that he is obsessed with his job and only wants to make people happy. of course he puts his family second to his work (although they were once his clients--another tantalizing irresolution). more than in exotica irresolution and contradiction is played up in adjuster, leading up to a number of amazing scenes that exemplify the ways that we are influenced or adjusted by the visual mediums which we abhor. the clearest example is the final porn screening when the new censor comes on to khanjian, who hesitates and then laughs, but laughter that is impure and begins at some point to resemble sobbing. anyway i think adjuster is one of agoyans best films, worthy of being watched many times.", "being a huge atom egoyan fan, i had high hopes for this film. unfortunately i came away thinking this film is mixed up and confused. the premise and some of the characters show a lot of potential but i feel that it is never realised.the set up is a look at the life of an insurance adjuster, and the effect he has on others. his wife works as a censor for pornographic films, and sexuality is a theme that runs deep. the main problem is probably that the film tries to say too much, and so you end up feeling that it lacks focus and direction.the film's saving grace is a great performance from elias koteas. it's unfortunate that it's not coupled with a better, more disiplined story and script. if you want to see how good egoyan really is watch exotica or the sweet hereafter, rather than this.", "first, the one bad thing about this film, its handling of sex. it's crass, and the fact that the lead character's wife works for the board of censors and watches a lot of pornography manages to be both pompously self-referential and irritatingly shallow at the same time, as well as leading to some completely unnecessary voyeurism.however, it is bang on in its handling of the lead character. theoretically unpromising as an insurance adjuster (although woody allen makes it work too!), in fact the way in which he interacts with his \"clients\" exposes interestingly the relationship between people and the service industry (think just how bad or good your bank can actually make your life).lots of great interior shots and visual invention, too. even pretty funny in places.", "this film should have been titled the sterile cuckoo, but that title had already been taken by another film. atom egoyan tries to get away from the mundane life of an insurance adjuster by adding kinky to the film every ten minutes or so. the formula falls short.it is different; and the kinky scenes are interesting, but not interesting or explored enough to alleviate the boredom of the basic plot. i enjoyed the scenes of the only professional actor in the film, maury chaykin (great performance in the legend of 1900, as a very convincing pervert). however, the rest of the acting crew was strictly local theater troupe level. not really recommended.", "imagine dining at a four star restaurant with wonderful ambiance, service, linen and dinnerware; great wine; a superb salad; and exquisite dessert but a totally botched and messy entree which you can't even identify. well, that's \"the adjuster\". an excellent film technically and artistically but a mess of a story which leads to an unsatisfying and eventually boring watch. peculiar for the sake of peculiar a good film does not make.", "this film gave me the creeps. i guess some people like that in a film, and of course that is their prerogative. sometimes a creepy film will have enough intrigue in other ways to keep my interest and appreciation, but this was not the case with the adjuster. i almost turned it off because it was making me dread what would happen next. the music made me nervous and i found the characters' neuroses neither amusing nor interesting. in fact, i thought the characters were quite flat in spite of their quirks.", "i've now seen exotica and the adjuster by atom egoyan and in my opinion he is a failed filmmaker. both are handsome films and the adjuster in particular is \"strange\" but both films fall flat. in exotica the only interesting moment in the film is the pet store owners cruising and eventual seduction of/by the customs officer. in the adjuster the only reason to watch the film is to witness the incredible performance by maury chaykin. he seems to be the only character who feels anything and i doubt it is something intentional by the director. i think it says more about maury chaykin and his ability to convey the written word into a highly complex set of emotions. (i want to see more of maury) maybe my opinion of atom egoyan will change if i ever see any of his other films, but from this small sample i can attest that he is merely a hack.", "'the adjuster' is my fourth atom egoyan movie and on my first viewing i wasn't as impressed as i expected to be. a second more thoughtful viewing of it made me appreciate it a lot more. i still don't think it's as good as 'the sweet hereafter' or 'felicia's journey', but i still recommended it for those looking for something unusual and thought provoking. egoyan makes very subtle and somewhat slow movies and they can sometimes be quite difficult viewing, but they are worth the effort. once again he uses a fine ensemble cast and an uncliched approach to story telling, but once you get into the swing of it you'll be hooked. elias koteas ('crash', 'the prophecy', 'gattaca') is a most underrated actor and his performance here as noah an enigmatic insurance adjuster is utterly brilliant. maury chaykin ('devil in a blue dress', 'money for nothing', 'jerry and tom') plays a wealthy ex-football player who crosses noah's path and is also exceptional. their complex performances make the movie for me. i also really liked the small supporting role by don mckellar ('roadkill', 'existenz', 'last night') as a wanna be film censor. all three actors would work with egoyan on subsequent projects, most notably 'exotica', my first egoyan experience. of his four movies i have seen to date i would rank them in order 1. 'the sweet hereafter' 2. 'felicia's journey' 3. 'exotica' and 4. 'the adjuster'. they are all very good movies and highly recommended. for beginner's 'felicia's journey' is probably the most accessible, but 'the sweet hereafter' is his masterpiece, and one of the most haunting movies of recent years. egoyan may go on to make even better movies but until then it's fascinating to watch 'the adjuster'.", "i've decided that egoyan is a minimalist. not only are great gaps created on purpose in the egoyan film script, an enormous amount of dialogue is left unwritten as well. including the adjuster i have seen at least three of his films. exotica is the one i remember the least, the sweet hereafter the one i recall best. sweet hereafter was closer to being a conventional film, its script an adaptation of a best-selling novel. but the egoyan filmstyle was visible in sweet hereafter too. it took a couple of viewings before i realized the father of the young girl in hereafter was having sex with his daughter before her involvement in the accident. it is an instance when leaving something not quite spoken or noted works out beautifully in the script. at least in the three films i have seen, unconventional sexual tastes are also a recurrent theme. egoyan is obsessed with them. i think he believes everyone is obsessed with sex in their own way. i believe he is right, but this director finds ways to make his characters borderline pervs while at the same time stressing their conventionality.an unanswered question in adjuster is how the crazed ex-footballer and filmmaker cum fantasist managed to find the adjuster. also, one of the fantasist's retinue of females managed to appear before the adjuster's wife on the subway, midway through the film. this is the woman in red who sits next to the decrepit bum after he has revealed his state, and puts his hand in her crotch and smiles joyously at the rest of the subway passengers. later the adjuster's porn-censoring wife repeats the inverse of the same gesture on herself when the 28 year old rookie film censor arranges to view some porn alone with her. there is also the question of what this woman is actually doing with the outtakes she films with a video camera. her story about the camera being a way to show her sister what she does is not convincing.yes, do go back and see the film again. there's all kinds of stuff in it.", "i am writing primarily because mike seemed to be unclear about some of the plot points in the film. as to the chance encounter between the adjuster's wife and the film-maker's spouse; the \"bum\" who the spouse debases herself with is, in fact, her husband dress as a bum.the wife of the adjuster gives the censored pornography to her sister. her sister derives some peace from watching it. why she feels this way is never explained.and now here is my review of this wonderful, if less-than-transparent film.i had already seen 1989's speaking parts and enjoyed it enough to see this film upon its release. the way atom makes pictures; (with much more said in silences or physical and psychological violence than is often imparted in dialogue) seems to have been set early. they have an almost painful to watch edge to them. and, like challenging art, is often difficult to fully realize upon a first viewing.this is also not my favorite film by this director. i love many aspects of this film. and i especially enjoy the heightened sense that reality is about to splinter that this film expresses so well. but my favorite is still exotica. the sweet hereafter is too hollywood and just not as devastating. but the adjuster has some of the best stick-in-your-mind images. it is impenetrable in spots. it refuses to give you all the answers. it has a \"happy\" ending if you can call avoiding death \"happy.\" but most of all it gives you entrée into a world you'd never see without this engraved invitation. no, this film is not for everyone. i am not going to bash folks who don't get it/like it. it is their prerogative. but for folks like me, folks who love amadovar, fellini and some of the other great filmmakers who show us the seamier side of life, then this is a very good, if not quite great film.", "the one thing i can always count on from atom egoyan is an interesting film. this is a brilliant, and very dark, comedy with a sensationally twisted plot, fabulous cast, and great cinematography. egoyan's use of light is excellent, as is the wonderful setting and scenery. this film is so imaginative that it's beyond a story told on the screen...visual poetry. and the frightening thing is that as good as this film is, it's not even his best effort. the pace was a bit slow at times, and at times the plot seemed to stagger a bit. his film-making was much sharper in exotica, which is my personal favourite. but the plot is so well devised (odd and twisted, and full of intricate details that are hard to really absorb the first time through) that it makes up for any lack of quality. elias koteas is really good in this; his best role save perhaps fallen, and he outshines arsinee khanjian who didn't quite feel up to par. my favourite role in the film, however, was a fabulous performance by maury chaykin as an unbalanced former football player. the gasoline scene is the best in the film, and chaykin's expression and lines are priceless. as well, look for don mckellar's excellent, though unfortunately small role, as tyler (the rookie censor). he's absolutely hilarious, and his delivery of dialogue is nothing short of brilliant. all i all, it's not egoyan's best effort, which means it still stands above most films. a really good quality indie-film, with a *very* original plot, quirky and memorable characters, and a strong cast. an easy 8/10.", "here's one of those art house films, out there in weidorama land, where the lead characters have interesting picked careers, that are both explored, which i found informative. most of the characters are odd, (it's a atom egoyan film, remember) and of course no forgetting wild actor, koteas. it's great to see him in a lead, especially in something like this. he's a very good actor, who i've followed since seeing him as the bitter paraplegic in that hogan fare, almost an angel. he's more impressive, the more stuff i see from this guy. here he plays an over caring and over sympathetic insurance adjuster to destroyed and devastated folk, who've lost their homes in fires. he sleeps with some of his clients too, and shows real generosity putting the shattered clients up in this motel. he also does one of the maids. his wife, arsinee khanjian is a pornographic censor, who gets caught up in her work, one might say, actually furtively, taping her flicks, and taking her work home to get off. could she be unfilled sexually? i really liked learning a bit, how the censor worked. and who is this real oddball director (chaykin) who uses their show home as a film location, where the lead actress begins to strip, while surrounded by a circle of little boys sitting. of course, we don't get past seeing her with her loud red bra, where what's followed is implied. the adjuster has a few strange moments, including one lesbian, feeling up another on a train in frank view of khanjian sitting across, fascinated. but none more unforgettable is obviously chaykin, beating off at koteas's window. chaykin too, has formed a weird relationship with khanjian's younger sister which provides a disturbing twist in it's end. even though koteas does his really good part, as a troubled and distressed guy, he's upstaged by chaykin who i thought rocked. his character was so intriguing, though the performance that really stuck, and it was a small part, was that of the head censor, hemblen. he was brilliant, almost beyond belief, so naturalistic, he too, providing another weird moment. with it's mini promotional poster, of elias, holding a bow and arrow (what's with that?) this was movie a movie that got my vested interested, i wasn't disappointed in any way by this movie, except, the high level sex scenes warning, the main one, where koteas is making love with one of his clients, in a teasing darkness, koteas and co, practically silhouettes. yes, it has style, is semi arousing, thought provoking, and of course, remotely original, but at the end of it, in spite of all these plusses, the adjuster, doesn't really equate to much. there just wasn't enough here, like filling to a sandwich. you walk away feeling unmoved, only that's not how you feel when you watch it. like many directors, eyogan went on to cast some of the same actors, for his better 'exotica'. definitely, still a recommended view. don't cross it off. some david lynch fans might get a buzz out of it too.", "a reflection about what makes everyone's life unique, through the story of noah's family. noah (elias koteas) is an adjuster, having sex with his customers. his wife hera watches pornographic movies for the board of censors. they live with their son simon and hera's sister in a show-flat. one day, they meet bubba (chris christie), who wants to make a movie in their house.i wish i had known about atom egoyan years ago. i only recently \"discovered\" his work, and it is generally excellent. between this and \"exotica\", i am not sure which i like more. he tells original stories, and puts elias koteas to good use... no one else seems to be able to do that, wasting him in supporting roles. (to mainstream audiences, koteas is casey jones but little else.) some of the plot confuses me, especially as it goes on, and it could use a second (or third viewing). and why not? this is the sort of picture to share with friends.", "(i can't believe the negative comments i have read on this page. i mean, sure, peoples opinions are allowed to differ- thats what makes this world so great blah blah blah etc... but this film is incredible and it would be a shame that someone would disregard renting it out on video because someone had bad-mouthed it here.)this film is set firmly in egoyan country. we have dysfunction, we have recorded media, we have beautiful shots, a wonderful score, great dialogue, fantastic use of silence (watch out for that one) and overall- you can feel an almost religious intensity beaming through the celluloid. my memory of this film consists of much more than just a plot- it is the warmth, the colours that stick with you too. one more thing... tarkovsky said that films best asset was its ability to sculpt in time. egoyans measured rhythm is hard to resist (obviously not for some people).it seems to me though, that the complaints here are not to do with the films form. of course it is well made. they have problems with the script, or at least the order of things. well, for me- the chaos and strange order of things in this film keeps it gripping- apart from the fact that you never know what is going to come next- isn't this half chaotic order a better rendition of reality than most? the content is also 'strange' and not really in keeping with 'popular taste'. so if you are easily offended, or more at home with spielberg- then please feel free to stick to him. but this is brave, sumptious, disturbing, invigorating, and beautiful territory. i was pleased to visit it.p.s. elias koteas' performance is probably one of my top five favourite performances ever, up there with takeshi kitano in bad cop and christopher walken in king of new york. stoic, tragic, he hardly puts a foot wrong.", "what a unique and challenging story to work through. the characters are so emotionally unavailable, it is nearly maddening. even after several days since i watched it, i can't stop thinking about what its purpose is. it requires a second viewing, if one is not too faint of heart. i loved it, even though i did not understand it all the first time. as a recommendation for all of egoyan's work -- if you're all about the quick fix of action-packed entertainment, look elsewhere. if you want an emotional, suspenseful piece of characterization steeped in a sort of horrid reality, well, this may just be the thing for you. it is a brain teaser. good luck to all.*there is also a charming short on the dvd for the adjuster called \"en passant\". it is worth a gander.", "i watched it right now. as always, atom egoyan has found a new topic and, as always,he gave us his specific approach to the theme. the way how camera is driven throughout the movie, gives a constant atmosphere of tension, enhanced by slow-motion frames in the movie. interesting film, otherwise i adore all his films, so it's no wonder i proclaim it as good.", "atom egoyan is an absolute genius, but i find it somewhat difficult to discuss his films as they are so complex. he seems to make the kinds of movies where you walk out of the theater after it's over and all the parts are clear in your head, but you can't quite piece them all together. but you can't help but try. sooner or later, everything falls into place, and sometimes it doesn't. either way, egoyan makes you really think about a lot of issues.\"the adjuster\" is about an insurance adjuster who helps victims of house fires get money from insurance companies. there is a really great parallel drawn between the adjuster, noah, and robin hood. he quite frequently shoots arrows with his bow at a billboard sign that says \"sherwood forest\". he is essentially taking money from the rich insurance companies and giving it to the poor victims of fires. we also have noah's voyeuristic wife hara, who is a film censor for porn flicks. she films what they censor with a video camera so that her sister can see what she does, as she has always shared everything with her sister. there is an extreme sense of bareness of the characters lives in the film. this is reinforced by the vast, open, almost desert landscape around the suburb. they own the only house in this particular suburb, and it is in fact a model house. even the books on the bookshelf inside are fake. all this seems to reinforce the lives that the characters live. this is a definite achievement from a cutting edge director.", "noah (elias koteas) is an insurance adjuster. he sleeps with ladies who suffered lost and arianne (jennifer dale) is the latest one who lost her home to fire. his wife hera (arsinée khanjian) watches movies for the board of censors and she secretly films the most brutal. they have a son with hera's sister are the only ones living in one of the model homes in an undeveloped field. tyler (don mckellar) is a new reviewer for the censors. bubba (maury chaykin) is a pornographer who's interested in noah's house. there is also a sex pervert stalker.i'm not sure what atom egoyan is trying to get at other than bring together a lot of the characters' dark side. the quest for a plot is left to the audience. it's a movie with a theme more than a story. one can really debate the point of each character and their significance. it's great to use modern sexual perversion as a launching off point but i like a story that moves more. it's a bit too slow and therefore feels repetitive with pregnant pauses. it's a movie that feels like it's saying something although i'll be damned if i know exactly what that is.", "even those who worship at the altar of egoyan would probably admit the adjuster needed a bit of, er, adjusting. the first half an hour of the film is so disjointed and gives so little information it's comical, almost like a parody of his later work. of course, this movie came before exotica and the sweet hereafter and is really only useful to those who enjoyed those films as an exercise to see where egoyan came from. and it goes to prove that no one, not egoyan, not scorsese, not spielberg, made their best pictures straight out of the gate. the adjuster has many of egoyan's signatures  explorations of photographic voyeurism, depraved sexuality, his wife  but in the adjuster he forgets to cross his ts and dot his is. the editing is particularly jarring, with little flow within scenes and jerky transitions between story lines. there are some interesting images, especially of the model home in the middle of nowhere and an interesting contrast between suburbia and the urban motel where elias koteas' character houses his clients/victims. egoyan deserves credit for pioneering this style of dreary, detached storytelling, which like it or not is truly original. of course, he is also responsible for the clones who have copied this style (last night, century hotel, the five senses) to less-than-desirable results and given canada the reputation of precious alternof---s. no, really, we're normal people who don't all have cold sex.", "this very quirky film by director atom egoyan is about an insurance adjuster noah, played by elias koteas. he is very empathetic to the victims of fires to their homes, and all of his clients end up staying in the same motel complex until their claims are settled (which never happens). a parallel story is about bubba and mimi, a rich couple who act out fantasies in public (she befriends him as he plays a sleeping derelict on the subway, she's a cheerleader for the football team-she is not a very young woman). the acting is fine, particularly bubba, who is played by maury chaykin. i've seen him in many other projects, i think he'll be familiar to you. my problem is the story is weird for weird's sake. who'd want to know these people? they are creepy, and the film becomes creepy. its cutting edge, but i wanted better character development. i felt it just didn't deliver. if you get the dvd, you'll be rewarded. included are two things which i really liked. one is the almost 20 minute film \"en passant\", starring maury chaykin and arsinee khanijan, who plays noah's wife in \"the adjuster\". it moves along at a good pace and tells a simple, but good story. the other thing is an interview with director atom egoyan. he is articulate and i found he is true to his craft. i also realized he directed the excellent \"the sweet hereafter\". i'd recommend that movie before you touch this film. but, if you see the dvd, buy it for the extras. check the film out. i didn't love it, but others here did.", "words cannot express how much i love the adjuster. it's actually been a while since i saw it, so i picked it up again, and well, fell in love with it once again. it's just that good.the cast consists of a canadian dream cast du jour: elias koteas! don mckellar! maury chaykin! arsinée khanjian! they're all dynamite here, playing some low down creepy characters here.koteas plays the titular adjuster in the movie, looking after people who've lost their houses in a fire. khanjian plays his wife, who makes a living from being a censor for the government (!!), don mckellar plays the new censor that was hired who catches on very quickly how to move up in the world. i'd rather not get into maury chayken's character if you don't mind lol all of these characters intermingle with each other. there's not a huge story to be found here, more of a character study. and what a study it is, as you find out a little more about each character with every viewing, with some mysteries yet to reveal (what was with the podiatrist?) can't recommend this movie enough. i have to say this is egoyan's crowning achievement, and i've been waiting for him to replicate it. (instead, he's been giving us crap like felicia's journey)", "first of all, this is painfully slow to watch. generally, i have no problem with slow-paced movies as long as there is something intriguing, like an exciting story, nice cinematography etc. not the case here. directing was good but this is one of the movies which should not be that slow, it's been made in an urban environment, there are no beautiful landscapes, there is no exciting story, something which could make me bear this pace. it should have been at least 15 minutes shorter.another thing : i love weird/bizarre/dream-like movies. the adjuster was something like that, but it is really flawed. imagine a david lynch movie without the warmth/brilliance/sensitivity, just way more cryptic, twisted and perverse. this was not beautiful to watch. not only twisted, in fact, it was even boring at times. too clinical and i could say cerebral, but i am not so sure because this was not some kind of brilliant movie.6 stars because actors were excellent and especially koteas : an underappreciated actor who should had a better career. furthermore, it was occasionally oddly interesting and i was curious to see where it goes. i didn't mind that it went nowhere, many great movies have no satisfying or clear ending. but even the journey which leads to this ending, was often frustrating to watch.", "early effort from director atom egoyan doesn't have the intricate sub-plots of his later movies but it does show that his penchant for stylized set pieces is not a new thing. from maury chaykin's elaborately staged sex romps for his wife to the hotel that the insured clients stay at; everything looks great but the movie itself seems sterile. elias koteas' performance sums it up best: cold and emotionless. sex plays a big role in this movie but no one enjoys it. from the movies that censor arsinée khanjian views to the \"extra\" benefits that koteas provides his clients - sex seems more a chore than anything else. even with chaykin's sex games, the excitement is more with the setup than the act itself. you know what? big deal! egoyan seems so intent on showing how detached (and boring) people can become that it is hard not to feel that way watching the movie. egoyan movies are worth watching because he really tries to make a statement but in most cases the films become exercises in making pretty pictures and in some cases, pretentiousness. this movie just misses being pretentious but it isn't very memorable either.", "this early atom egoyan film is truly the best of his movies that i have seen, and they are \"exotica\", \"felecia's journey\", \"the sweet hereafter\", \"speaking parts\" and of course \"adjuster\". egoyan has a very special gift and that is the way he tells the stories, a way that forces the characters to do things you wouldn't think they'll do, or do them in a very un-expected way. egoyan drives you into the story using all the tools included in a film director's case: beautiful, almost dreamy photography, haunting mysterious music,careful attention to movement and color. that is the case with all his films but in \"adjuster\" this unique style of his really comes to a peak. the strange story of an insurance adjuster being eaten inside by guilt and fear seems to take place in a world where morality and good are disappearing slowly, living the honest man to burn is his own hell, created by his inability to read the reality that lies before him. this is always a very good story material for films, because it allows the filmmaker an investigation of the psyche, tormented, searching, afraid and yet unable to tie all ropes together to make sense of the world. i recommend watching \"the adjuster\" and then watching it again after a day or two. if you dig movies, you will not forget this one. an exceptional experience.", "agree with the previous post.. this film is extraordinary and i'm amazed at the negative reactions here. i would rate it as my favourite film of all..it's an incredible and subtle meditation on what means to be alive, to be human, to love. to be human and to be confronted by this fragmented, alienating, disturbing modern existence .. with our lives and interactions largely filtered through technology and our experiences so far removed from those of our ancestors and those before.i was provoked and amazed by this piece of work - and i'd urge anyone who wants to be challenged to see it.james", "at the center of egoyan's dark journey into moral and materialistic devastation is elias koteas' noah, the mortal bearing the film's title, carrying its weight -- certainly delivering the goods in what must be considered his finest ninety-plus minutes on film. he never disappoints this viewer (his cameo turn as \"the kisser\" in lagravenese's living out loud was a landmark in my memory simply as a point of relief, an answered prayer).mychael danna's score and steven munro's sound design push the adjuster past the dream world threshold, unraveling it strand by strand to catch and spin in the viewer's subconscious. this is one you wont shake easily. egoyan magic.", "canadian filmmaker atom egoyan redefines the black comic satire of his earlier films ('family viewing', 'speaking parts'), but for all its dark wit and visual sophistication the effort doesn't add up to anything more than a cast of unattractive characters in search of a plot. these include, in ascending order of eccentricity: a handsome insurance agent who uses his control over the victims of catastrophe for sexual favors; his wife, a government film censor who secretly bootlegs violent porn movies for her apathetic sister; a filthy rich couple with a fetish for enacting elaborate exhibitionist fantasies; and so forth. the film is disturbing, perverse, sporadically funny, and totally original, bit also inscrutable to the point of confusion: it gives the impression of depth without clearly saying much about anything at all. egoyan is a filmmaker of obvious and distinctive talents, but he needs (once again) to build a stronger story around his strange characters.", "this is a great movie. you should watch it again. i agree that it is not one of agoyans most accessible films but there are many elements that first surfaced in adjuster that are featured prominently in his later works (exotica, calendar, sha). following on the impetus of many cutting edge directors agoyan employs plot elipses to avoid a forced resolution in both exotica and adjuster--in other words he creates interactions that are never really resolved, symbolized in the act of striptease. playing on the role of the erotic in both films, agoyan goes over the top with exotica--although i think it is a great film--falling back on the erotic material it others in a way that he subtly avoids in adjuster. the only real onscreen sex occurs while the adjuster and one of his clients talk about some of the loopholes of the insurance claims, a provocative and hilarious scene. the adjuster, you are led to believe is a pervert or something to that extent, but the truth is that he is obsessed with his job and only wants to make people happy. of course he puts his family second to his work (although they were once his clients--another tantalizing irresolution). more than in exotica irresolution and contradiction is played up in adjuster, leading up to a number of amazing scenes that exemplify the ways that we are influenced or adjusted by the visual mediums which we abhor. the clearest example is the final porn screening when the new censor comes on to khanjian, who hesitates and then laughs, but laughter that is impure and begins at some point to resemble sobbing. anyway i think adjuster is one of agoyans best films, worthy of being watched many times.", "being a huge atom egoyan fan, i had high hopes for this film. unfortunately i came away thinking this film is mixed up and confused. the premise and some of the characters show a lot of potential but i feel that it is never realised.the set up is a look at the life of an insurance adjuster, and the effect he has on others. his wife works as a censor for pornographic films, and sexuality is a theme that runs deep. the main problem is probably that the film tries to say too much, and so you end up feeling that it lacks focus and direction.the film's saving grace is a great performance from elias koteas. it's unfortunate that it's not coupled with a better, more disiplined story and script. if you want to see how good egoyan really is watch exotica or the sweet hereafter, rather than this.", "first, the one bad thing about this film, its handling of sex. it's crass, and the fact that the lead character's wife works for the board of censors and watches a lot of pornography manages to be both pompously self-referential and irritatingly shallow at the same time, as well as leading to some completely unnecessary voyeurism.however, it is bang on in its handling of the lead character. theoretically unpromising as an insurance adjuster (although woody allen makes it work too!), in fact the way in which he interacts with his \"clients\" exposes interestingly the relationship between people and the service industry (think just how bad or good your bank can actually make your life).lots of great interior shots and visual invention, too. even pretty funny in places.", "this film should have been titled the sterile cuckoo, but that title had already been taken by another film. atom egoyan tries to get away from the mundane life of an insurance adjuster by adding kinky to the film every ten minutes or so. the formula falls short.it is different; and the kinky scenes are interesting, but not interesting or explored enough to alleviate the boredom of the basic plot. i enjoyed the scenes of the only professional actor in the film, maury chaykin (great performance in the legend of 1900, as a very convincing pervert). however, the rest of the acting crew was strictly local theater troupe level. not really recommended.", "imagine dining at a four star restaurant with wonderful ambiance, service, linen and dinnerware; great wine; a superb salad; and exquisite dessert but a totally botched and messy entree which you can't even identify. well, that's \"the adjuster\". an excellent film technically and artistically but a mess of a story which leads to an unsatisfying and eventually boring watch. peculiar for the sake of peculiar a good film does not make."]}

the strong recommendation of the panel of 'le masque et la plume' i went to see this film.i was struck by, as others have said here, the fraternity that existed between the priests. i thought the most interesting aspect of the film was the relationship between the priests. at times you can feel the tension because of the strong decision they had to make. also it being 7-8 men living together it was interesting to see the different personalities in a group environment; you have the natural leader, the introverted, the brave, the scared etc.etc.i imagine like most people who've seen this film the performance by wilson lambert was very touching. he was totally believable as the cloister's leader.unfortunately the church is undergoing a very hard time in regards mostly to child abuse, it's nice to have a reminder of the positive aspects. i myself went to a catholic school with some brothers and a monastery on campus. i have a very positive image.particular favourite scenes are when they prepare and sell the honey at market and of course when they listen to swan lake and enjoy a glass of wine.", "in 1996, in algeria, eight french monks of the monastery notre-dame de l'atlas of tibhirine have a simple life serving the poor community that was raised around the monastery. during the algerian civil war, they are threatened by terrorist but they decide to stay in the country and not return to france.one night, the extremists break in the monastery and abduct seven monks. a couple of months later, they are found dead in controversial circumstances.\"des hommes et des dieux\" is a film based on a true story and supported by top-notch performances. the official and non-official versions of the death of the tibhirine priests can be found in internet. my vote is seven. title (brazil): \"homens e deuses\" (\"men and gods\")", "i seem to fall between the two camps of critical reaction. the majority who feel this is a classic, great film, or a sizable minority who call the film boring, historically inaccurate, and all surface. i find myself agreeing with some points made by the critics, e.g., being bothered that the film never really examines how hated the french were for their earlier colonialism. that larger context is part of what makes these brothers targets. one passing mention is hardly enough to deal with a huge element of the underpinnings of the story. you could use it to make the brothers seem even more brave and to more deeply understand that they took a risk to reach out and just be there even before things get 'bad', and/or to make the hatred they faced from the terrorists and the army not just seem random. to be clear, that hatred is unforgivable. but understanding how something happened, or why your enemy hates you doesn't equal forgiving terrorism. but is part of the path to peace. and it is something these wise, well read monks would have known about and must have been part of their thoughts and discussions, though its largely avoided here.i also agree that the film is slow in parts, sometimes needed to establish the rhythm of the monks' lives, but other times getting repetitive with no seeming advantage. in addition, besides the two main characters, the other monks are largely one-note sketches, and the sudden turn around of those who wanted to leave – maybe the most fascinating action in the film - is largely under explored, some of the time spent used on repeated rituals or re-tread conversations could have been used to deepen the understanding of those men and their heartrending confusion. it also bothered me that those who wanted to leave are never given the strong or convincing arguments they easily could have. they're almost made to seem cowardly, or 'wrong'. the film could have gone further in it's compassion towards these men, and understanding that this was a complex decision, even on a theological level. when does god want us to martyr ourselves and when would god rather we not sacrifice the gift of life to find a way to live to fight another day? i can think of a number of third choices between surrender and simply running away. these men must have examined those options, but there is little sign of it here. i have no problem with the film's conclusion, but i wish it had felt both sides presented with equal weight and seriousness, as i assume must have happened among the real monks. but my biggest problem is that the film's style, while inviting thought, is somewhat emotionally distancing, so while my brain was deeply engaged, my heart was less than i wish it was. i wanted to weep for these men and for the world, but i found myself more caught in mind than in emotions. i believe the story was strong enough to carry both. now, all that said, i still think, unlike many of the professional critics that raised these points, that this is a very, very good film, made with intelligence and passion. it is visually simple but stunning to look at. its slow pace adds to the meditative, un-hollywood feel that eschews inflating drama for its own sake, and allows us a taste of the peace these men experience by living in their simple, giving way, even in the midst of war. and there are scenes of sheer brilliance, where whole stories are told on peoples' faces with little or no dialogue. scenes where a combination of photography and acting capture a huge range of complex emotions. we watch fear, joy, transcendence, defeat, and loss run through the hearts of these men within seconds of each other without a word needing to be said, that is film-making of a high order. ultimately, this is a film that deserves and needs to be seen. a plea for peace and courage in the face of hatred. but that doesn't mean it isn't a flawed work, or that acknowledging those flaws dismisses those very good things the film does accomplish.", "the other day i watched the film compliance, which tells a true story in the form of a drama. i didn't find much in the film and wondered why it added nothing to the events other than showing them. i mention this because the opposite is true with of gods and men. here we have a true story told but done in a way that adds to the characters, engages the viewer and has room for thought. the priests of the story struggle with whether or not to leave their monastery in algeria once it becomes very dangerous due to the actions of fundamentalists in the region. this is the majority of the film in a nutshell and as such it is perhaps not a film that could stand a mass audience.i don't say this in a condescending way, but just that the film is probably too slow for the casual viewer – not that others \"won't get it\" or any such nonsense as that. i liked the film but even for me there were times where it lingered too long or spent too long showing us certain aspects of life in the monastery. it did feel longer than 2 hours and i think this is mostly down to the fact that the whole film has a very slow pace and very gentle delivery. the upside of this is that it does have more emotional impact as a result – because the characters are clearer, we understand their minds and i enjoyed that i was able to see their struggle and also understand the reasons for their decisions because i had seen the role they played.the film matches the slow pace with some beautiful shots; visually it is a very still film and it does feel at times that it is like a great painting, with the use of light and atmosphere. the performances are where the film delivers best though. everyone is strong and seems to have understood their characters very well because they are convincing and engaging. the ballet music meal towards the end of the film is the best example but there are plenty of equally strong and expressive moments throughout.it is a slow film and even though i liked it, i did still struggle with the glacial pace at times. it rewards and satisfies at the same time, but a few times you do need to stick with it while it unfolds slowly.", "i saw this last month at the 2011 palm springs international film festival where it won the fipresci award for best foreign language film. it has also won in that same category by the national board of review and was france's official submission to the academy awards for best foreign language film although it didn't make the short list. making its debut at the cannes film festival it went on to win the grand prix award there. this is set in 1996 and is based on the events of a true story that took place during the struggle for power by different islamic guerrilla groups and the government in algeria. caught in the middle are a group of french roman catholic trappist order of cistercians of the strict observance operating the self-sufficient monastery of tibhiirine in the algeian highlands and helping the people its nearby village. the monks have been largely left alone by the area guerrilla fighters but when their leader is killed he is replaced by an even more brutal leader and the threat to their existence is imminent. they must decide to stay or go. from writer/director xavier beauvois this is a dark film that moves slow in it's two hours. great cinematography from veteran photographer caroline champetier with a beautiful production design by barthélémy in converting an abandoned monastery in morroco that hadn't been used in 40 years for the setting. lambert wilson leads the ensemble cast as the christian the leader of the monks with veteran actor michael lonsdale as the monastery and village doctor. this film is about 30 minutes to long and too artistically clichéd for my liking. lots of audiences and critics love it but i would only give it a 7.0 out 10", "as vivekananda has said, \"the intensest love that humanity has ever known has come from religion, and the most diabolical hatred that humanity has known has come from religion.\" both of these elements are present in xavier beauvois of gods and men, the story of seven roman catholic french trappist monks kidnapped by radical islamists from their monastery in the village of tibhirine in algeria during the 1990s algerian civil war. the film depicts the sacrifices people of good will in both religions are willing to make for each other, and that the separation between religions is not an unbridgeable gap.winner of the grand prix at the 2010 cannes film festival, of gods and men stars lambert wilson as christian, prior of the monks, and 79-year-old michael lonsdale as a world weary medic who treats up to 150 moslem villagers each day. the film derives its title from the book of psalms, psalm 82:6-7 quoted at the beginning of the film: \"i have said, ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most high. but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.\" filmed in morocco, the film shows the daily life of the trappist monks before the terrorist threat becomes real.though a large part of their day consists of contemplation and devotion, living in close contact with the muslim population allows them to interact with them in a positive way, healing the sick, selling honey in the nearby markets, and caring for the aged. in addition, daily chores such as cooking, gardening, loading wood for the fireplace, and cleaning take up a large part of the day. soon word gets around about the murder of european workers on a construction site by the terrorists and the monks recoil in horror when they learn about the stabbing of a woman riding on a bus by islamic fundamentalists simply because she was not wearing a veil.the algerian government asks the monks to leave for their own safety but christian tells them that their calling is to serve the people of the community and he insists on remaining, though he is willing to let the other monks decide. the issue becomes suddenly more immediate when a group of fundamentalists show up at the monastery on christmas eve demanding medicine for their wounded colleagues. though the request is refused, christian quotes the koran to their spokesman ali fayattia (farid larbi) and they end up shaking hands, though the prior senses rightly that they will be back.when all agree that they will not abandon the monastery even at the risk of death, the dramatic high point of the film is reached when the monks recreate the last supper by sitting around a small table drinking wine and listening to a recording of tchaikovsky's swan lake ballet. as the camera pans from face to face, we can observe a beatific smile on some faces and tears on others, demonstrating an inner poetry and reverence for life. the monks are not christian moralists but spiritualists confronting the extremes of the human condition, characters who point the way to overcoming despair.the monks, like the curé de torcy in bernanos' diary of a country priest, love poverty \"with a deep, reasoned, lucid love as equal loves equal\", expressing the eternal struggle of the spirit to know christ and to come to terms with his anguish. the heroes of the film are not saints. they are flesh and blood human beings, full of ambiguity and fear, but never far from compassion and humility, willing to offer us the possibility of a world transformed by grace.", "chris morris's debut four lions (2010) found fame in it's irreverent portrayal of islamic fundamentalism in yorkshire: the headlines that accompanied brass eye (1997-2001) successfully carried on into a low-key marketing campaign in that debut feature. beauvois' film isn't so much a farcical account of the spiralling contradictions of religious extremism. but it does share its preoccupation with exactly how far one, or rather a small community, can go to devote themselves to their beliefs.the film is located in the 1996 algerian civil war, and tells the true story of a monastery under threat from the armed islamic group of algeria (gia). dom. christian (lambert wilson) takes it upon himself to express their intentions to ignore the threats, and continue their mission of goodwill. this is disputed by the group throughout, whose dilemma forces some of them to question their allegiance to god, and jeopardise their own health (as with the outstanding michael lonsdale's, luc). coping with the sacrifices involved in such an all-consuming faith is key to the themes here (\"we're not here for martyrdom\" reminds christian), and it's difficult to recall a more delicate, understated study. an excellent example of beauvois' achievement, both visually and performance-wise, is the kiss luc places on the mural of christ. moments like this underline the dependency they all share on one thing alone: their religion. it looms over them, both haunting and cradling them throughout, like the vast, unspoiled skylines which constantly diminish them beneath - caroline champetier's cinematography is key to the affect created.tranquil moments like luc's, where the viewer is allowed in such close, personal space, are almost unsettling in the access that's granted. the beauty achieved in these meditative scenes is all the more striking as we're reminded that these men are nearing the end of their lives. death is always present – from direct representation (as with the brutal throat-slitting of the croat workers) to the indirect (the technique of cutting from the most tranquil scene to the loudest, most destructive scene).the film is an anti-thriller in its treatment of fear and terror - the key moment occurs before the half-way point, and the viewer is left fearing for a reprisal for the duration. beauvois' alternative narrative, featuring a fairly clear split down the middle, also featured in his previous don't forget you're going to die (1995) and to mathieu (2000). similarly, more recently, mia hansen-love's father of my children (2010) involved a number of characters picking up the pieces in the wake of death. french colonialism in algeria is only once directly attacked, when the police chief demands they leave. however, when viewed in a similar light to, say, hidden (cache, michael haneke, 2005), the occupation these men choose, the service they provided, the sacrifice they made, could too, easily be forgotten. so while the terrorism fears, today shared globally, are a focal point, a narrative of this kind reminds one not to forget the horrors of the past.of gods and men is testament to a thriving new french cinema. thought-provoking, rich in content both (formally and thematically), it's difficult to find fault with a film that so meticulously justifies its choices: the landscape is artwork, the tone is perfect, and the performances are achingly affective throughout.", "i will not bother to describe the plot as it has been done other places. what i experienced as important in the movie was the changing dynamic between the monks as the drama progressed, from doubt and critical thinking about what the right decision is to religious, ambiguous, circular reasoning in the end, and how a norm for self-destruction emerged through their group interactions. throughout the movie there is a heavy emphasis on religious texts and i miss more screen time for the monks' own thoughts and conversations, not just one psalm after another.the scene that gripped me the most by far was a scene where the monks ate together and drank wine while they listened to classical music. in this scene they actually live in the moment instead of contemplating religious past or future and they come alive in a much more profound sense than earlier in the movie (except maybe for some of the scenes with michael lonsdale who does a very good job in the movie).all in all an ok movie that shows how dangerous it can be not to question beliefs, this regarding both the cistercians and the islamists.", "this film appealed to me in several ways. i liked the direct, intimate approach in the way it was filmed. it was very refreshing to see hymns used as a big part of the soundtrack, very different as to what you usually hear :) in the cinema where i was watching the film, the average age must have been a lot higher than usual, and a few seats away, someone was even quietly singing along with some of the hymns, very bizarre feeling in a cinema!! i liked the fact that they treated the subject of faith and the possibility of coexistence of christianity and islam, as well as the differences, in a very simple, every-day-life-way. what was new to me was the visualization of fraternity. this aspect was a big thing throughout the whole movie. it is one of the things i least understood about priests and monks until now. it was amazing to see this feeling i have never personally experienced come alive on the screen and sort of being able to feel it myself. i also liked that they used 'real' people and not pretty hollywood types, but i suppose that is normal in a production like this. i liked that a lot was left unspoken, unexplained and open for various interpretations.the scenes i liked best was the one where: *the abbot was at a lake to find inspiration for his tough decision. *the 'last supper' with the close-ups of the monks' faces and the ballet music *the terrorist and the abbot talk about the birth of jesus *the ending (usually i don't like abrupt and vague endings like these, but in this film it was bearable and befitting, because in real life it is also still unknown what exactly has happened).", "i said, 'you are \"gods\"; you are all sons of the most high. psalm 82(mildly recommended) based on a true story, xavier beauvois' of gods and men, tell the disturbing account of eight christian monks living their pacifist beliefs while struggling to surmount the violence that surrounds their monastery. as the war around them heightens, they must decide to stay in algeria with their devoted villagers or escape to france for their own safety. it is their continual debate of conscience that is the core of the film, especially when these holy men are confronted with islamic extremists and an unforgiving army. two of the film's central characters are brother christian ( lambert wilson ), the stoic leader of this men and guiding force and brother luc ( michael lonsdale ), the monastery's aging and wise doctor who tends to the sick and infirmed in this muslim area. these fine actors bring a solemn and commanding presence to their roles. some of the other monks come off a bit too pious or saintly due to the nature of the script and the dire situation. of gods and men is far too leisurely paced. the director seems to be overly caught up in the monks' ritualistic lives, which, quite honestly is a bit of a bore. a clearer focus of the political turmoil engulfing the community is needed with more emphasis on the unrest and the monks' direct reaction to it rather than countless extensive scenes of worship and prayer. much of the film, in fact, too much of the film becomes steeped in religious ideology and sanctimonious moralizing. the film becomes preachy and self-righteous. ( i was left asking myself if the monks' final decisions was indeed the right one, which might be my own religious bias coming into play. when dealing with the subject of religious zealots, i wondered if both factions, those being the catholic priests and the islamic terrorists, were extremists in their own right, which i am sure was not the filmmakers intent. )yet, the film's last half hour remains moving and unsettling. beauvois' use of the music from swan lake is an effective counterpoint to the intense facial expressions by the cast of actors as they contemplated their characters' fates. the film's final image, a wintry scene of the monks marching into the forest only to disappear from view is quite hypnotic and touching. were only the rest of of gods and men that powerful! do i hear an amen, brother? grade: b-", "¨des hommes et des dieux¨is a magnificent religious picture about faith and sacrifice . under threat by islamic terrorists, a group (laudembach , rabourdin ,

holy feeling, faith and martyrdom.", "greetings again from the darkness. this film may be tough for much of the american audience. there are long stretches of minimal dialogue and more filmed prayer than i ever recall seeing. this is based on the true story of eight trappist monks who are caught in the middle between some 1996 fundamentalist terrorists and the algerian-muslim village that the monastery serves.the driving theme is the question facing the dedicated monks ... should they remain in the monastery and support the village or should they retreat and live to serve another community. the film does a terrific job of examining the strength of faith among this group who are still just human beings ... men who don't wish to die.the government has ordered them to leave and the military has offered to protect them. the group, led by christian (lambert wilson), decline the military offer and continually discuss the idea of leaving. the wisest of the monks, luc (michael lonsdale), is in failing health. he is also the doctor and can't imagine leaving the villagers with no medical care.director xavier beauvois (le petit lieutenant) creates a fantastic scene where the monks make their final decision to stay. their dinner and wine event is set to the tune of the black swan symphony. really something to behold as smiles and relief make their way around the table. of course, as with most of the foreboding hymns sung throughout, we understand that their fate is decided.the sparseness and serenity of the monastery is offset by the inner turmoil each of the monks face. this is presented very effectively but i do think the film misses an opportunity to shed more light on the overall political struggles of the time. we are really left in the dark on these issues and it becomes a very intimate, narrow focus on these 8 men.", "i feel awful about giving this film a low score, but i felt i had to on the merits of my levels of interest in what was happening or what was about to happen. it very much played out like the daily life of a monk - nothing was hurried, everything was calm and done in a pure and careful manner. in this way it perfectly matched the mood and the setting of the subjects of the film. but it meant that as a viewer we sat and watched while the characters would have endless prayer meetings, or silent contemplations, or long walks, or read books (to themselves - we don't even know what they were reading), or eat food, or have more prayers, or go for another walk. all done without a word spoken. this went on. and on. and on .... and on. the acting was very good from all parts, and it certainly felt realistic from all parts. but if, like me, you are not a christian, you begin to question the depth of the story. of course, it is a terribly sad true story. but then again, in war, there are millions of sad true stories. it almost felt like it was an attempt to glorify the religion, rather than to tell the story, since - as the film says at the end - the ultimate events were never known. in summary, it's a story which doesn't stand out from any other sad story of conflict, but we watch nearly two hours of nothing really happening, followed by film makers' guesses as to what may have happened at the end. i wouldn't advise watching this unless you strongly desire to feel closer to the world of a monk, and to feel closer to a film maker's guess at an individual story of war.", "it is a support for memories. about christian message and about the mission to give the word of god everywhere. about the relation between catholics and islam across the history. about values, martyrs, tolerance and the life of monk. about lessons of faith as lessons about courage. about god. and about orient, terrorism, options and roots. about men. and about gods. and the force to remain yourself under danger. each of this details, the performances - michael lonsdale does more than an admirable job - ,the tension, the hymns, the monastery life different by ordinary clichés, the magnificent scenes who gives more force, sensitivity and dramatic than dialogues or images are steps to a real trip in the past.\" des hommes et des dieux\" is a magnificent film. it is the only definition who could remains able after you see it.", "of gods and men (loosely) tells the tragic true story of the french trappist monks of the monastery of tibhirine in algeria, who were kidnapped by islamic terrorists and killed either intentionally by them, or accidentally by the algerian army in a rescue attempt.in the midst of a civil war the monks are wise enough to know they are potential victims, and spend the little time they have deciding whether they should continue serving their mainly muslim flock or leave. we see their vacillating attitudes as they question the morality of their role and the strength of their spirituality.lambert wilson and screen veteran michael lonsdale (particularly brilliant here) have prominent roles; wilson as the scholarly leader, christian, and lonsdale as luc, a man imbued with a lifetime's supply of philosophy, not all of it religious.i've seen many films where the pace has been deliberately slow. sometimes the effect is soporific, but here it couldn't have worked any other way (though the esteemed film critic pauline kael would have called this film 'offensively holy'). we need to get used to the spartan life of these monks so that the terrorist threat, when it comes, is suitably shocking.many who have reviewed this film have singled out, with easy justification, the last supper scene. what makes the scene so breathtakingly cathartic for the monks (and maybe for the audience, too) is that its peculiarity destroys its predictability. they eat in silence while swan lake plays in the background, allowing their silent interactions to express an eternity of emotion. it has the power to rival the comparable scene in 'the shawshank redemption'.what's interesting about this film is that, while the central theme is thick with religion, there are other themes as stimulating. there is a debate to be had about the political points the film conjures in respect of colonisation and the feasibility of east/west cohabitation. for those interested in theology, there is piquant dialogue on the worth of religion and the interpretation of ethics.faith is presented here as both the force which gives the monks the courage to stay in their monastery, and the thing which ultimately sends them to their deaths. if you don't make the mistake of concentrating too much on the religious element you might find this a rewarding experience.www.scottishreview.net", "the plot of this film can be summarised as: christian monks live peacefully in muslim country, political situation changes, monks have to decide whether to leave or to stay. boring, you may say, nothing happens, you may say and, in one sense you'd be right. but..... the point about this film is not the plot. what this film acknowledges is that the real drama of human existence is internal, the real action in our lives takes place inside of us and the real journeys that we make are in our minds and our souls. this is a film about relationships, between different communities, between individual members of the same community, between individuals and god and between individuals and themselves. this is a film about identity and place - two things we all have in common, like it or not. personally, i found the religious aspect of the film intriguing. we live in a world in which religion is, again, being used to justify momentous acts. an analysis of how that works and what it means has to be relevant. but even if you are not interested by this, or are, as i know many people are, turned off by the mention of the words \"religion\" or \"god\" what the film does is to allow it's audience to begin to look behind these literal concepts at how the spiritual (whatever that might mean to you) functions in our daily lives. so, 9/10. 10/10 is very tempting but the film is not perfect. it would probably be boring if it was and a very definite recommendation. oh, and by the way, it has some beautiful scenery, some stunning and innovative cinematography and some crackingly good looking men.", "this semi-documentary based of true historical facts, tries to recreate the state of mind of catholic monks. they know the consequences of their choice : if they stay in their monastery they will be killed by terrorists; if they return to france they can save their lives. in the beginning three of the seven monks want to survive, and want lo leave. at the end of the film they unanimously choose to stay. why ? decision making is all what the film is about. so this is a psychological film. it is hardly fiction. we see them praying, singing, working, eating. behaviour determines conviction. rituals, psalm singing, silence, charity create and harden the monks belief. their merciful god is the product of their way of live, and that god is the warrant of their decision. the decision of self destruction. a great example of religious horror, the catholic version of religious suicide. brilliant social cinema.", "of gods and men (2010) des hommes et des dieux (original title) directed by xavier beauvois, is a powerful drama about good, deeply religious mentrying to live a truly caring, peaceful life under difficult circumstances.a small group of french monks have lived in a monastery in algeria for many years. they are clearly different in a cultural sense from the surrounding community. however, their simple life and acts of charity are welcomed and accepted by the muslims in the adjacent village.the plot revolves around the threat of death from militants in the region. the algerian revolution has succeeded in forcing out the french colonial forces. the algerian government and army officials want the monks to leave and return to france for reasons of safety. the monastery is seen as a remnant of colonialism, and is therefore the target of nationalistic and religious violence. the problem revolves around the questions, \"will the monks stay?\" and \"what will happen if they do?\"lambert wilson plays christian, the elected leader of the monks. he does an outstanding job of portraying a man who could have succeeded as a leader in almost any undertaking. however, he has chosen monastic life, and now his leadership has become a matter of life and death.veteran french actor michael lonsdale plays luc, an elderly physician who can barely walk, but can still heal. the acting is uniformly excellent. in fact, the acting was so good that my wife and i had to remind ourselves that this is a movie, and these men are actors,not monks.the music, mostly chants sung daily by the monks, was superb.this is a very powerful film. we saw it at the excellent little theatre in rochester, ny. if you can't see it in a theater, the movie should work almost as well on dvd.", "i was surprised to see that some of the reviewers bring their politics to criticize this film. one claims it is really left wing. interesting, since the right seems to be the one with the most fanatical base. i am not a particularly religious person, but i have no trouble showing respect for those whose religion is based on service and compassion. these trappist monks have a choice. to follow the teachings of their god or leave behind those who they have served and who depended on them. there is little discussion, despite terrorists sweeping through algeria. there is great tension when the traditionally powerless are faced with the (and i use this term for effect) godlessness of the terrorists. these are good people who never expect anything from their neighbors, who are predominately muslim. the down side of this movie is that we all know exactly how it is going to end. it is also rather dramatic in its portrayal. closeup are a significant part of filmmaking but the contrived scene of \"the last supper\" (lower case for me) is a bit over the top. it was hard to put aside my own prejudices as i watched this.", "some imdb reviews complain this movie is slow. they are right, but fail to understand that the slowness is in the service of the story. these are men that choose to lead a life of routine and work and service. they choose a life in which each day follows the previous, and meaning comes from curing wounds in small children and selling honey in the local market so they can heal more wounds tomorrow.some reviewers say nothing really happens in this movie. apart for a bunch of murders and the monks' bravery and despair, they are right. the monks seem passive. they foolishly choose to die rather than flee. they surrender their lives to the will of the god they believe in and the love of the community they have served for a hundred years. is that dumb?was that the right thing to do? what purpose did their sacrifice serve? what if they had fled? what would the rest of their lives been like? i love it when a movie makes me truly think. this one did.", "i went to see the movie about two weeks ago here in lévis. i had read a lot about it and i was really looking forward to seeing it. it is a good movie, but somehow, not transcendent as i was hoping.the depiction of monastic life is very realistic, with st. benedict's rule in application. you see the monks pray, work, mostly in silence as they do in real life. but when it comes to touching the core of faith, love, and even though lambert wilson, michael lonsdale and all the other actors do an outstanding job, it falls short of what it could have achieved. it does raise good questions about how to live our lives. roger ebert said that he would have chosen another path for the monks, had he been their prior, but if you truly love your neighbor, can you abandon him? the monks' choice, given their faith, is perfectly sensible, and they aren't made out to be saints and martyrs. conveying that feeling of grace and love is much more difficult though, and i blame this in part on my own expectations, not on the movie itself.in the end, a good movie. but not transcendent.as an edit, i must admit, that the movie, just like the monks, does not proselytise, which is probably why i felt a bit let-down in the end. if so, that's probably a good thing, and i realize that depicting harmonious coexistence is more essential than ever in today's world.", "long! long faces. long scenes. long, long shots. i understand that this story has historical and religious significance. i understand that it is based on a true story that is dramatic and compelling. this movie is not.we quickly see that these are french monks at a monastery in algeria. but do we really need scene after scene of the catholic liturgy, with gregorian chants, that go on from start to finish? after the first one, they add nothing to the story, or our understanding of the characters, other than to make you pray... pray the scene will soon be over.do we really need repeated long shots of a car driving on a barren road, starting at one edge of the screen, and driving slowly, slowly, toward the other edge, until it finally clears the shot? i know. let action clear the edge of the screen before you cut. but this was not action. it was molasses flowing.and it is not the fault of the actors, who are clearly good at their craft. but it seems as if the director pointed the camera at each one of them and told them to emote. and they did. and the director said, \"that's it. keep on emoting. emote more. more...\" and when the director was done with that actor he turned to the next and said, \"emote. keep emoting. more. more...\" seriously, there is one scene where that is exactly what they do. with all eight monks. in fact, they may have gone around the table twice. i lost track.there are a handful of tense scenes (a small handful, believe me) with the terrorists, and with the army. but these were poorly developed, and remarkably un-tense considering the events.and yet you stick with it because of the high ratings. you think, \"this has to get better. the film won awards. people rave about it.\" don't think that. if you don't love this film from the beginning, you will not love it at the end. it never gets better.these \"film makers\" never learned that it is plot and character that drive a movie... not how long you can hold your finger on the camera's shutter release before yelling \"cut!\"", "i saw this film immediately after watching \"the way back\", and that experience made me imagine how must feel a movie critic, when he is sitting film after film during the whole day. how can they stand it?? by my second film i was almost passing out, sleepy and in deep need to go to bed.but i sat there and watched this second movie: what a mistake. i only assume that \"des hommes et des dieux\" must be an excellent film. i found it, after half an hour, lengthy and quite boring. since i don't have any kind of religious believes, those scenes where they go through a complete religious ceremony singing a capella and the camera remains fixed as if filming theater, i felt what w. c. fields had wished to be written on his tombstone: \"i'd rather be in philadelphia\" instead of watching this very slowly paced movie. i must confess (in harmony with the subject-matter) that i felt asleep several times during the projection --sorry-- and every time this bunch of old priests started a new religious song (prayer or whatever it's called) in that empty room, all facing the back wall, singing to a perfect void (where i suppose was their divinity listening to them), i couldn't help but to think: well, this business seems to do them a great deal of good, they go through life singing a little, pottering in the garden a little, eating very well a lot and who knows, maybe that's a simple and sane way to have a good and long life after all (they all were over fifty and some even over 70).but i suppose one must have what they name \"a call\" for that life. i cannot advise anyone about seeing or not this film, since it implies a very personal experience, especially for the religious of mind.", "one can react to a film in many ways including: intellectually, viscerally, emotionally, cognitively, spiritually and aesthetically. one's reaction to a particular film is the result of complex interactions of all of the above and the characteristics of the film itself. certain films are more likely to bring out particular types of reactions. this film works on many levels and will draw out complex and individual responses from each viewer. my responses were heavily influenced by my being a member of catholic men's religious order that has a long (and ongoing) history or missionary work that, at times, puts our men in danger. this was true in the centuries since our founding and remains true for a number of my friends who are working \"undercover\" in several countries. i first watched of gods and men with another member of the order who had already seen it but wanted to share the video and the experience with me. we watched on a small not very good tv with wretched sound. but within moments of the opening all of that faded away. when it was over i sat in the dark room stunned. i know several trappist monks. i admire their lives and occasionally retreat at one of the their monasteries. while their vocation to contemplative monastic life is not my vocation, the bond of being in religious vows allows us to share something fundamental and vital. i was stunned when i read about the killings in algeria and followed the story closely in the papers. before watching the film i read the very well-written the monks of tibhirine that supplied some back story and biographical information that was not included in the film, a great deal about the history of islamic fundamentalism in algeria and much history of the french in algeria. the scenes during which the men were discerning god's will, both as a community and individually, ring true. the lack of consensus, the bickering, the fear, the acceptance and the gradual movement of the spirit are the same for all orders when they engage in corporate discernment emerging from each member's individual discernment. though forewarned by my buddy, the scene of swan lake playing in the refectory was emotionally wrenching. the looks on the men's faces as the music swirled and the sense of community returned could never be described in words. i've been as deeply moved and emotionally drained each time i've watched the movie since (about four times since the initial viewing a year ago). quibbles about the lack of action are absurd. that is not the kind of life we lead as religious. prayer, mass, and contemplation (even in an active order) are the backbone of our lives together and as individuals. the combination of the honesty of the portrayals of the men's and the community's spiritual crises along with the sublime cinematography combine to make this an extraordinary film on all levels.", "based on a true story, this film depicts a small group of french catholic monks who lived in a monastery in algeria and worked in harmony with local muslim villagers. in the mid-1990s, the monks and the villagers' lives are threatened by a growing terrorism movement and increased military presence.this film can be credited for authenticity. most of the actors playing the monks are ordinary-looking and the style of directing and acting is austere and somber. while this would be the expected feeling for a monastery, i found the overall mood a bit too drab at times. this film might have learnt from the style of another recent film of monastic life, \"vision: the life of hildegard von bingen\" which occasionally used directing techniques to add to the beauty of the atmosphere while still seeming authentic.despite this misgiving, there is still much to admire in \"of gods and men\". most important are the debates among the monks on whether they should leave the country for their safety or stay to continue to help the villagers who would be worse off if the monks leave. there are also genuine discussions on faith, destiny and one's true calling in life. these discussions (along with some beautiful chanting by the monks) are the foundation of the film. - dbamateurcritic.", "depending on your prejudices and perspectives this will be either wondrous to behold or deadly dull. at opposite ends if you're an impatient atheist you won't get much out of this maybe apart from admiring all the languorous panoramic views of bits of algeria, contemplative chanting and emotive acting. maybe! if you're a tolerant christian it will be an engrossing journey full of deep inner meanings, rustling cassocks and dogs barking in the unidirectional distance. maybe not! one side can fume at perceived do-gooders soft on evil - whatever that might be, the other will rejoice in the perceived moral and intellectual superiority of their religion - whatever that might be. i try to tread the middle way: a well meaning well made film of a group of men saddled with a big problem: religions.true story of a band of monks minding their own business and their flock while getting gradually caught up in civil war, their inner anguish over whether to stay or leave and of course, ours. christianity might have progressed slightly since the dark ages, but it still seems overall the motto of religion is gotta kill – the film reaffirms the view it's so much easier to destroy than create, these monks tried to create good around them but as usual were beaten by the forces of satan. when will the world's working class or people with no money at all stop killing the world's working class or people with no money at all? what difference did the murder of tens of millions of old men make to the battalions of our betters in ww2? the monks' inter-relationships were well shown, tender respect at (nearly) all times but imho unfortunately and unintentionally occasionally bordering to those evinced by the 7 dwarfs to each other in snow white. a lot of little things happen and add up during the 2 hours (reminiscent of some of akira kurosawa's classics), one of the most poignant for me being christian's spectacles steaming up with the emotion at being part of the simple camaraderie at the supper table. the film's end was poignant too but the real ending was only alluded to, as it probably wasn't on-message! forgive my flippancy but i know for a solid fact true believers are too holy to be nasty to me and true deniers shouldn't care at all. the copy i watched had small arty times font english subtitles but not too irritating. was it worth the time and cost to me or not? yes - remember it's a true story - it's thoughtful and thought provoking, maybe not in ways it was meant to but the only thing i can advise to do is settle down and see what you think. if you're in a somnolent posture you probably won't make it to the end though!", "of gods and men starts out rather softly and rather reeks out the lonesomeness of the monastery. then the story builds up well, with repeated moments of heightened tensions and subsequent moments of slow down. that way the story being told can be viewed as one not so scary. in a way, the movie succeeds in telling the story from the perspective of the monks themselves who have surrendered their lives to god long before they meet death. the movie portrays the relationship between the monastery and the surrounding community very nicely, in a way that many fanatics will get disgruntled with. the acting is a nice overall. the aura of stillness is balanced between all the monks, despite the varying levels of fear, tranquility and or anxiety among the characters.", "\"of gods and men\" is a very well made french-language film. however, i also think it has limited appeal, as most folks who go to the theater want to laugh and be entertained. \"of gods and men\", on the other hand, is a quiet little film--one that might inspire you but certainly won't appeal to broader audiences. i can understand, however, how this film impressed people at cannes and other film festivals--it's a quality film that makes you think--having a greater depth than a typical film.this story is about a small monastery with eight monks in algeria during the 1990s. the nation was racked with civil war--with islamists committing terror acts across the country. here in the us, the news hardly ever talks about this nation--though the death count in all this strife has been horrific during the last few decades (between 150,000-200,000 deaths in this rather small nation). through the course of this film based on real events, the men must decide whether to leave or to stay. they want to stay, as the local villagers care about them and rely on the monks' medical care--but the men have no desire to stay just to become martyrs--especially since the islamists have been targeting christians. what will come of them? the film is inspiring but, fortunately, not in a cloying manner. it is not just some feel-good film but represents people acting like real people--with all their doubts and conflicts. while not a huge crowd-pleaser, the film is very good and worth your time.by the way, michael lonsdale got a lot of praise and an award for his part in the film. he was the villain from the bad james bond film \"moonraker\" and very frequent actor/supporting actor in french films--and he was very good in the film. however, so were all the cast members and i cannot see why lonsdale alone received the césar award (sort of like a french oscar) as best supporting actor. odd. perhaps this was intended as sort of a lifetime achievement award, as this very prolific actor has more than 200 credits as of 2011!", "i am a christian. i think the reaction on this film may be different between those who have any religious belief and those who don't.i don't know when and why a catholic monarch, in which all monks are french, was established in an arabic village of algeria. but it seems the presence of the monarch was something important in the village. in fact one of the monks does medical service. nevertheless, they are neither soldiers nor social workers nor missionaries, but they pray and work.when it became reality that their life was in danger as islamic extremists had come, they had to decide whether if they stay and continue praying at the place. do we ever live here? is there any difference in praying here or at other place? is there any meaning in being killed here? conversely, is there any meaning of living here? not through logical thinking but through prayer, the monks pursued to find the answer, and they were led to deeper confirmation of their calling to follow jesus. the last scene resembles the way of the cross of jesus.", "xavier beauvois's 'des hommes et des dieux' (a title that was translated into english with a reversal of nouns as 'of gods and men') addresses the complex issue of confronting terrorism in the arab world by focusing on an event with a strong symbolic and emotional charge that took place in 1996 - the taking of hostages and the tragic death of seven monks in a trappist monastery in the mountains of algeria. to be more precise, most of the film is about the events that preceded the actions of the terrorists, the coexistence of the monks with the surrounding muslim population and their moral and religious dilemmas. this is a different point of view from most films that deal with this area of conflict, a perspective that gives originality to the approach but which in the end is also the main weakness of the film.there are many beautiful moments in 'des hommes et des dieux'. the landscapes of the atlas mountains, the chapel and the refectory of the monastery, the adjacent village are filmed with a cinematic lens in which aesthetics and love each have their share. some of the takes have the dramatic beauty of paintings by caravaggio or el greco. the human landscape is of the same chosen quality, especially when it comes to the nine monks (seven of whom will end tragically) and the villagers. each of the nine men represents a distinct personality, the interpretations are simple and profound at the same time, their dedication and dilemmas are rigorously experienced by the actors and shared with the spectators. it would be worth mentioning all the names, i will not do it, i will only mention lambert wilson in the role of father christian and michael lonsdale in the role of the doctor and brother luc, who, i think, create in this film two of the best roles in their careers.the perspective presented is beautiful and emotional. it's hard not to be moved and to admire the dedication of these people who choose to live in the middle of a community in a foreign country, helping people belonging to a foreign religion, without missionary intentions (at least nothing is visible in the film). their dilemma is tragic. few people today choose the option (even as a risk) of martyrdom. but here lays also the main problem of the film. the events are well known, the rhetoric of martyrdom as well as the idealization of the relations between villagers and monks sound good and very politically correct, but they are too idealized to be totally credible. the complex aspects of the conflicts, starting from the sources of terrorism, the corruption of the army and the civil administration and the historical role played by french colonialism are touched very partially or not at all. 'des hommes et des dieux' proposes a beautiful and original cinematic vision, but only a partial perspective of a complicated reality.", "i saw this movie because of a very positive opinion i heard in the week these monks were beatified by the catholic church. this person said it was the best movie about faith he had ever seen. not for me. martin scorsese's \"silence\" was up to today the best picture to bring to life a journey of faith. in this movie, though a lot was said, even if not in so many words, i felt it could have gone a lot more deeper. the film is nevertheless beautiful, the story inspiring and the acting superb. very slow, just like \"silence\", but i am of the opinion that some stories need to be told in a slower pace. if you have to choose between the 2 i'd recommend scorsese's.", "it's amazing a cinema audience can sit totally silent through a 2-hour-film, filled with various religious speculations. but it occurs here.this is based on a true story. eight catholic monks are living in a monastery in algeria in the middle of the 1990s. they are surrounded by a muslim village towards which their relation is very good. but then, the fundamentalist terrorists arrive and they start to live under constant threat.much is said here about fighting violence by your example or escape from a possible death. the monastery everyday life is contrasted against the sometimes unexpected brutality. lots of thoughts and well acted.", "this film chronicles an important historical event, and the nobility and gravity of the subject matter are undeniable. on the surface, this film examines the struggle of a group of trappist monks who must decide whether to remain at their monastery to face terrorism or flee to their native france. on a more profound level, this film problematizes the depth of belief and conviction—the power of abstract faith—when it's pitted against very real and practical dangers. given all that, i really wanted to like this movie. on an intellectual and philosophical level, i do—i appreciate its complexity and the importance of its subject matter. but as a work of cinematic art—as an act of storytelling—this film falls short. there is very little action to speak of, and much of the film depicts the monks in prayer, reciting religious articles, debating the strength of their conviction, theologizing, philosophizing and contemplating the virtue of religion against the ugly reality of politics. sadly, i was quite bored for most of the film—it's essentially a drama that's dramatized in a very undramatic fashion—through voice-overs, prayers, and debates. ultimately, i was disappointed and left with the feeling that this could have been a much better film than it turned out to be.", "this intimate and moving film is about a paradox: what do you do when through time, love, faith, and commitment you find yourselves truly accepted by the community you live in; and in turn love them back - but, remain, in the eyes of others, a symbol of the foreign, the undesirable - through no fault or action of your own. if your very life is threatened do you abandon the community or do you stay?by opting for a non-melodramatic, almost semi-documentary, approach, of gods and men took this viewer into the monastic world in a way that resonated with the spiritual and resounded moreover with a clear humanity.in a simple aesthetic we have the complete monastic experience, from the silent discipline to plain chant, but somewhere in this simplicity, somehow, something truly personal and human creeps in and despite this resolute austerity we do begin to know each figure and to understand their fears their courage, their faith.above all, this is a film about faith, not about hope, or courage, or blind willfulness, and though it mostly succeeds, as with any exploration of faith, it can only hint at the incredible complex juxtapositions involved here. yet in opting for apparent and transparent simplicity and clarity we actually arrive at a more complex place that we might if the director, xavier beauvois, had opted for a multifaceted storyline - by focusing our attention on the seven monks we end up with a surprisingly complex tapestry.all in all, this is a very beautiful film about a very dreadful event - simply told and realized. it is a film that i will remember for a long time - and all the more powerful for its appreciation of certainty and uncertainty.i am in no way surprised that this won the palme d'or at the cannes film festival - sincere, honest, moving; it contains a sense of values and integrity that lift it and define a specific and special place in film.", "i did not want to like this film- i have little sympathy or respect for the remnants of brutal colonial system, and i think little of the catholic church in general. (i am myself, a former catholic). in any case, i was shockingly surprised that i very much enjoyed the film. i did wind up infinitely respecting the monks as portrayed. they were not in a remote region of algeria to do any evil whatsoever, or to try to convert anyone, or teach the locals anything about catholicism.they lived in a strange, peaceful, respectful, symbiotic. harmonious relationship with the local muslim population who were overwhelming supportive and respecting of them. the monks were absolutely selfless to the point of obsessing in their pursuit/quest of helping the local villagers with everything from free footwear, to free prescription drugs and medical treatment. apparently at least one of the brothers was a medical doctor. the meager, paltry, few cents of coins they made by selling honey from their bee-hive, at local outdoor markets, virtually was all given back to the community in one form or another. the leader (monsignor?) of the monk group, even won the respect and protection of one leader from the terrorist groups who had arrived in the area, by going 'toe to toe' with the him in quoting koranic passages and verses. and of course it's all based on a true story. i'm a misanthrope as well as a person who is totally down on organized religion. however, a small percentage of my faith in humanity, as being capable for doing any good whatsoever, was restored after viewing this film. but to phrase it in somewhat religious terms- ultimately human ignorance, violent brutality, and evil once again prevailed. i think everyone knows the ending of this film. but yes, this is an intelligent film, with many uplifting moments. i highly recommend it.", "i have to begin by saying that this turned out to be not at all what i was expecting it to be. and that's ok! i have no argument with it. it's a wonderful movie - just an unexpected story. from what i had read i was expecting a story abut french monks taken hostage by islamic militants in algeria and their struggle in captivity. instead, we're really introduced to the lives of the french monks before they're taken captive, and with their increasing struggles to live faithfully in an environment increasingly hostile to them. the monastery has a close relationship with local muslim villagers - providing especially medical care to them, one of the monks being a medical doctor. islamic extremism is on the rise, though. the extremism seems here to be less religious than cultural, though, directed more against the french than against christianity. with their monastery increasingly under threat, the monks begin to grapple with their calling. what are they to do? they believe god has called them to this place and to serve christ by serving these people. now, with the threat increasing daily, do they pack up and run and save themselves, or do they stay and take the risk of continuing to serve. the leader of the monastery (brother christian, played by lambert wilson) clearly wants to stay, and he refuses an offer of protection from the government, but the others challenge his authority. he was not chosen to make all the decisions, he's told. the community must have a voice in its own future. some feel called to stay; others feel as if they should leave. at least one is struggling with faith in god altogether. how much should one be willing to sacrifice for god and in response to what one believes to be god's call? \"whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.\" that's a rough paraphrase of a teaching of jesus which comes up in the movie as well. and it's tough. how far does it go? and if we're willing to lose our life for the sake of christ and gospel, are we merely risking martyrdom or are we actively seeking martyrdom? that gets questioned here, as well.most christians are never called to such depths of soul-searching. most of us never have to risk our lives. most christians in the western world anyway wonder whether we even want to give up an hour or two on sunday morning to attend worship. and many aren't even willing to give that. i have a friend who's pointed out that he knows people who'll say they'd die for christ but they won't attend church because it's boring. so they'll die for their faith, but they won't be bored for an hour for it? for comfortable, western christians this is (or should be) a very humbling story as we contemplate how little we're asked to sacrifice and as we often decide that we won't do it, while others in different parts of the world are asked to sacrifice a lot (and sometimes everything) and are willing to accept and pay the price of faith. it is both humbling and thought-provoking.i especially appreciated the portrayal of islam in this. it was made very clear that the \"bad guys\" (so to speak) were not representative of islam. they were extremists; people who in many ways had betrayed the very faith they claimed to represent. the peaceful relationships between the christian monks and the muslim villagers was positive and hopeful - a side of the islamic world that i wish more westerners could see in this era in which anti-muslim feeling is increasing.this is not the exciting, action-packed, thriller that i thought i might be getting into when i chose it. it's thoughtful and reflective - even poetic in some respects. it's in french, with english sub-titles. somehow in this movie, that worked better for me than it usually does. it's very well done and people of christian faith especially should watch this and be forced to think about the calling and limits of their own faith. how far would you go for christ? (8/10)", "this is a wildly over rated film. i was quite looking forward to it but, found the incessant scenes of monks living their solitary existence farming, praying, eating and chanting to be painfully boring.i echo the sentiment of another reviewer and felt as if i had been heavily sedated while watching this film. yes, we saw a few segments of the monks interacting with the local algerians at social events but, we never really had a chance to discover the individual personalities of any of the characters.the film would have benefited had there been some endearing moments of humor or whimsy to make us feel closer to these men. instead however by the time the story reaches its inevitable conclusion it is nowhere as powerful or sad as it might have been because we have barely glimpsed these characters personalities beyond the excessively dull scenes of them in prayer.this is the cinematic equivalent of counting sheep. by the time the first chanting scene arrives you will be in a deep and restful slumber. sweet dreams.", "a slow-burner and potently religious hymn, 2010 cannes best director winner, my belated viewing is deterred by the fact that it is based on a brutal historical occurrence. apparently the film itself holds steady its rumination and put it into a anti-theatrical perspective, instead of stressing the atrocity of slaughter.a gradual stewing of incessant depictions of nature sceneries is both a challenge for patience and a dedicative elucidation of the christian gospel. juxtaposing with american's contemporary christian films (e.g. fireproof 2008, courageous 2011 and all that whose only trick is some kind of revoltingly mawkish doctrinairism), of gods and men are endearingly touching under the backdrops of an impecunious algerian community.an impending danger hovers along the narrative, like a ticking time bomb, there will be no miracle for escapists to avoid from the horrendous truth, the most overpowering moment arrives when the swan lake is playing during their last supper, one realizes there is the swan song for them, the close-ups focusing on each individual's face, resonates a world with utter devotedness and sublimates all the mundane afflictions into fearlessness and peace. last but not the least, the final snow-treading sequence fulfills immaculately as a solemn and austere crowning moment.michael lonsdale, the earnest standout as the elder doctor, a true scene-stealer supporting performance among a sterling french cast shepherded by a model-turned-priest lambert wilson, whose sorrowful countenance and stalwart faithfulness grants him a career-peak tour- de-force. the elegiac and over-religious attribute may hinder its appeal from a more diverse audience, but the risk is worthy as it is a film with genuine integrity which induces people to look into oneself introspectively and generates a will to be a better person under any circumstances (speaking as an agnostic myself).", "what makes this film so enduring in its powerful impact is its consistent style of convincing piety, trust, faith and every christian virtue you ever heard of. the language of the cinematography is unique but comes closest to the style of the danish director carl th. dreyer in his very stylistic films, like \"the day of wrath\" made during the war under similar threats as this quiet, gentle, slow and infinitely.meek and humble almost documentary approach to the life of the secluded trappist monks far beyond everywhere way up in the atlas mountains somewhere among natives of a very primitive village. there is a sweetness hovering och dominating the entire film, as the monks first are divided whether to leave or stay on, and then all decide to stay on just because the threats and atrocities around them increase. the final scene is unforgettable and will etch itself in your memory forever in its infinite sadness. i saw the film now for the third time, but every time i have seen it it has made an even deeper impression. in all its simplicity, it is one of the profoundest films ever made.", "it's a religious drama set from ca. 1990 to 1996 at the trappist monastery of tibhirine near médéa, algeria. it recounts events at the monastery during the algerian civil war from 1991 to 2002.the monastery is adjacent to a muslim village that grew up near the monastery partly because of the protection it provided from the algerian army and more radical islamist rebel groups like the groupe islamique armé. the film follows the work and worship of the eight monks and their relationship with the muslim villagers. brother christian (lambert wilson) is the prior and strong leader who becomes more democratic as the monks' situation deteriorates. brother luc (michael lonsdale) is an elderly physician who treats many villagers. the other monks have distinct personalities and roles but figure less in the storyline.as the civil war escalates, it becomes clear the monastery is trusted neither by the army nor the rebels. however, the first encounter with the insurgents ends peacefully, and brother luc treats anyone who comes to his clinics, including rebels. ali fayattia (farid larbi), head of the local rebel group, protects the monastery until the army kills him. however, fayattia's successor (adel bencherif) is less sympathetic.\"of gods and men\" is a compelling movie about sustaining religious commitment in the face of extreme danger. the fear and uncertainty about whether to leave or stay are portrayed head-on. the worship scenes are remarkable and include approximately 15 chants. the cinematography, especially close-ups of the monks' faces, is striking. the decision-making process, as brother christian's rigidity lessens, is well-presented. the film's ending is appropriate given what is known about events in 1996.", "of monks who live their life for god, and of terrorists who we don't know for whom they live their life. the terrorists were likely supposed to be nameless, faceless antagonists. the monks were probably supposed to be the opposite. but for a film with so much set-up, there was so little characterization and plot.i'm usually not one for action, in most cases, the less the better. i am one for characters, and will find things in them to cling to even when they're not there. but here, whether or not it was lost in translation, there was nothing to these men of god.the monastery was in a small village where nearby workers were killed by terrorists. the monks were told they needed police protection but they refused. half of them believed they need to stay since the village needed them. the other half wanted to leave. why the villagers needed them wasn't entirely clear. yes, the monastery did have a much-needed doctor, but it's not like they provided jobs.this is based on a true story. that's what i knew going in, and that's all i knew coming out. i don't know where the story's set, or when, or what the point of it is. i wanted to be educated, and that's mostly why i'm disappointed because i didn't learn anything about this recent history and lifestyle.i do have a sneaking suspicion that the point of the story is about coming to inner peace in the face of outside violence by living your life for the love of a greater being. that greater being would be god. although i don't know which sect of religion these monks adhere to, they would likely be open to people believing in any god if it provided you with meaning, love and peace.\"of gods and men\" is highly praised by most critics. they were probably inspired by the personal resolutions that the monks had to come to. i, on the other hand, don't believe in any greater being. in an effort to not entirely blame this subtle film, that's probably why i didn't find any greater element to connect to.", "first, i should mention that any summary of this film i've seen is wrong. it is *not* about seven trappist monks who are taken captive; it is about eight (and briefly nine) trappist monks who are living with the fear of capture or death.that said, this is a slow-paced, subtle, beautifully acted and filmed depiction of the psychology of men of a certain kind in these trying circumstances. the moral lessons regarding religion and tolerance are good but very simple, and distinctly secondary. (it is, after all, based on truth, which is rarely neatly focused around moral lessons.) the action is trivial. what matters is the people. they are real people, sometimes admirable, but very human. they talk now and then, but they think first. they are not heroes, except sometimes, and in a very limited sense; they are just people with a degree of faith and love, and a strong wish to live up to their own ideals.as others have mentioned, it is beautifully photographed. it is also quiet (there is no background music whatsoever, only the music the characters themselves provide) and slow-paced, and the persistent tension comes only from the knowledge of the fear under which the characters are living.i cannot think of this quite as a war drama, but rather as a story of nine men whose lives, at this particular time, happen to be affected not only by their faith, and their work, and their friends, and their individual doubts and aspirations, but also by a kind of war.", "the plot is fairly straightforward: a group of monks in war-torn algeria have to decide whether to leave - and thereby ensure their survival - or stay, as their way of life has been threatened by a group of insurgents. what gives xavier beauvois' film its extraordinary power is the way in which it shows how some human beings cannot be brow-beaten into doing anything they don't want to. the monks have nothing on their side except the power of prayer and an unshakable faith in god, but they make the best of these qualities to put up stern resistance. compared to them, the insurgents are presented as unsubtle, believing as they do that the gun can persuade anyone to do anything. as the elected leader of the monks, lambert wilson's christian is just brilliant; his expression seldom changes, but we understand the power of his resolve. the supporting performances are equally good, especially jacques herlin as amédée, one of the oldest monks who doubles up as a doctor caring for members of the community around him. director beauvois makes subtle use of gregorian chant to point up the theme of the movie. what i particularly like about of gods and men is its refusal to make generalizations; it does not posit christianity as being in any way superior to other religions (e.g. islam), but suggests instead that any religion should be a force for peace rather than a pretext for violence.", "'of gods and men' is a low-key, understated film about a group of french priests living in a monastery in algeria. they are noble, kindhearted individuals who genuinely have an affection for the local native people, but their lives get threatened by the growing violence during the algerian civil war in the mid-1990s.this film works for the most part due to the characters involved. all the priests in the monastery are normal, relatable individuals. they have uneventful, mundane lives with nothing much to look forward to except praying to god and being kind and helpful to others. they make an active effort to mingle with the local muslim people. they join in during the local rituals, fairs and religious ceremonies. some of the priests also make an effort to learn about the koran and not stay restricted to their own religious teachings. they help the poor with clothes and shoes and also with medical treatment and medicines. so clearly the viewer can't help but like and adore these kind,elderly righteous group of priests. it is because of this very fondness for them, we also feel the horror of the situation that they get to face in the film. with the gradual spread of civil war throughout the algerian country during the mid 1990s, there seemed to be a rise of intolerance towards foreigners and followers of other faiths among native extremists and the priests also fail to escape this volatile and dangerous predicament. after getting attacked on one occasion by a group of terrorists, they find themselves stranded and helpless. they face the dilemma of having to choose their lives' safety and leave the country or stay and continue to help the poor and beaten down by putting their own lives at risk.the style of storytelling is fantastic. the director makes us really feel for the characters involved. the debates and conversations that the priests have during their meetings reminded me very much of '12 angry men'. the director also makes an effort to show that violence existed on both sides. the manner in which the algerian army searched and investigated the monastery on suspicion that the priests were helping the terrorists was eerily similar to the way the terrorists had attacked the monastery earlier. the director shows that the priests were caught in the middle of two sides who were intent on destroying each other through violence. the look of the film is also very realistic. the director with the production designer succeeds in recreating the feel of the relevant period. there are also a few visually meaningful, but quiet scenes involving sceneries that i loved.the only problem that i had with the film was that i thought the screenplay gets a bit bogged down in the middle with repetitive scenes and it gets a bit too preachy and melodramatic in an otherwise very well written screenplay. the acting is solid form everyone, with a special mention for michael lonsdale.so although i think the film is not perfect, it is still a rewarding watch with great acting, directing and a good screenplay and i also loved the scene with which the film ends. it is a quiet scene with no dialogue, but it is a scene which says everything about acceptance, embracing others and religious equality.", "the film explores love as truth and not so many of the false ways it has been tagged through the years. the is the love at the highest level of consciousness, the holistic height of spiral dynamic's human development scale. it's no surprise that critics see it as a story of religious fundamentalism and all of the unfavorable things it implies. it is hardly a perfect piece of film making. it could stand editing in several places, reduce its length, and provide a better understanding as to what was going on in the civil war in algiers in the 1990s, when a monastery was seen as a colonial intrusion. the film was not short on excellent performances by its old actors, and beautiful photography of what i understand was actually morocco. but the chief achievement of the picture lies in its depiction of the power of trans-personal spirituality and what that means in shaping lives and conditions.", "this film is very well produced and acted. it's quite easy in fact to forget that these are actors and feel that you've been invited into the confines of the monastery and the experience of these cloistered monks. this is accomplished, in part, because of the heavy emphasis on the liturgical life of the monks. a deeply spiritual film, it is uncompromising in it's depiction of the life of a cloistered monk, putting the life of catholic prayer and it's spiritual dimensions at center screen. the process that the monks go through as they deliberate the threat that they face is deeply informed by christ and his passion. and while there is no way to really capture the inner reality of a group of eight men devoted entirely to god as they go through this traumatic time, i think the film does a great service to what happened (it is based on actual events). despite having different motives, different levels of religious fervor and sometimes conflicting desires towards self-preservation, the focus on perseverance in service to the community (despite being cloistered trappists, who take an oath of silence, and generally do not make an active ministry)is deeply humanizing. this is the kinds of film, i think that western society needs and helps remind us, even as we slide ever more deeply into pointless self-interest, that our highest values and finest aspirations coalesce when we are centered in service to the one who made us.", "this has been the most terrible movie i have ever seen in the theatre. it is incredibly boring, such that i think a genuine effort was put into making it so. i almost got up to leave the theatre a few times during the movie. the story is very weak, and the only way they could pull it off was to say at the end that it was based on a true story. the story is awfully superficial, not coherent, and in some ways an advocate of colonial ideology... one can't understand what these people were doing there in the first place. i assume the french government supported the corrupt poppet government of algeria at the time, and by observing the uprising in the mid-east these days, one can understand who is really on whose side and how the people of those countries really feel about their governments and their supporters. the movie tries so hard to show the monks' presence was essential for the people of the region that they couldn't live without them; but the question that comes to mind is that how could the villagers survived the history if it was so... possibly the light version of the missionary propaganda. i was misled by the positive reviews, and am not sure how come most of the reviews are so uniformly positive. i can not see anyone who is not particularly interested in the christian faith to like or enjoy this movie even a bit.beautiful pictures though, and that is the only reason the movie may deserve a 4/10.", "\"men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from a religious conviction...\" (blaise pascal) although religious denominations are meant to spread peace and love, or at least promote it, the facts usually occur otherwise. religions aim at preaching equality; yet some fundamental groups shoot to kill still believing that \"god is with them\" and their victims are 'infidels.' and at the encounter with religious prejudices, a lot of wordy and worldly researches/theories are being manifested but they achieve little of the desirable target. instead of walls being tumbled down, vague misunderstanding is being born and humanity constantly experiences a decadent, closely locked circle of vengeance and violence. what occurs most useful in such a reality? the director xavier beauvois has come up with the creative idea: speak to men again by means of film art, by means of a picture that is, on the one hand, deeply rooted within the tradition of anti-war films; yet, on the other hand, speaks to all of us with the modern language. the film puts aside all clichés that would hardly occur authentic. it addresses the very core of individual sense of beauty vs sensitivity to violence. the director is not afraid to address the very core of what it means to listen to the whispering, ever-present voice of love. the 20th century has proclaimed the death of god...yet, people still think of him...why? each viewer is invited to ask herself/himself a question: where is god if he exists? is he in the clouds or rather deep within human hearts? and that is the key success of the picture we see for those two hours which are not in vain.there is no doubt that of gods and men is one of the most realistic, shocking and thought provoking films you can ever see. it manifests the realism of the events in morocco at the end of the 20th century – very up-to-date events dealing with a terrorist danger and its hatred...something we constantly hear in the world news...yet, something that finds a new light here. the monks who live in harmony and work for the kingdom of peace are contrasted with the terrorists whose desires and acts are driven by sheer violence and the lack of mercy. both have their \"god\". which \"god\" is true? in between those two groups (we could say biblically the children of light and the children of darkness) come simple, innocent people who work hard, who struggle for simple feelings, who fall in love, who dream, who do not bother with ideologies and theologies but whose key desire is a very basic one, the one of every human being: to stay alive and learn to be happy. it is so little, yet it occurs so much...the most thought provoking aspect of the film is equal to what the world experiences at the moment: the conflict between the civilization/reality of death, hatred and vengeance and the civilization of life, love and forgiveness. that struggle is beautifully executed in the symbolic (almost) christmas eve scene - a crucial moment for the entire movie where two leaders of the two \"realities\" meet and share hands, for a while perhaps, but share them because this night is like no other night. the prince of peace is born...lambert wilson who plays christian, the leader of the monks, gives a haunting performance combining these dimensions of courage and sentimentality. he is someone who takes responsibility for others but respects their free choices; he is someone who can look at the face of his enemy with forgiveness. among many other characters, i particularly empathized with the physician luc memorably portrayed by sympathetic michael lonsdale.a great artistic merit of the film is the lovely manifestation of man's spirit and man's nature through symbolic almost mystical images, shots of morocco's landscapes and the sublime use of music. whilst wilderness, there is human search; whilst fog, there is human mystique; whilst darkness, there is human uncertainty; whilst sunshine, there is human illumination and joy. the gregorian chants and the fragments of the psalms in the vespers constitute an additional merit to the whole atmosphere. certain psalm texts come with certain events. the climactic moment for artistic and symbolic significance of this movie is the supper of the monks with close-ups of their faces, their teary eyes. they have already made their mutual/individual decision(s) to stay...the past is dead, the future is unborn, just this moment pays off like in \"carpe diem\" maxim. the last supper-like moment supplied with the profoundly beautiful tunes of tschaikovsky's \"swan lake\" occur to be one of the most powerful scenes you can ever see. something you never forget...such a feast of love.a very meaningful film, something to experience, particularly because it is based on true events. the finale will leave you so calm, so reflective. 9/10within the night of the world, they captured one exceptional night of child's appearance when all demons of war give in before the prince of peace. brothers in arms who fight the spiritual battle and finally walk towards the fog's mystique, the world needs your example, the world needs your courage!", "of gods and men charts the lives of 8 christian monks living in a small algerian village in the mid 90's. despite their religious differences they are fully integrated and at peace with the local muslims, providing medical services and work to their neighbours. based on a true story we watch how they cope with the stress and danger of the rising wave of radical islamic fundamentalism after the massacre of foreign workers in a nearby town. the movie is slow moving but gripping as we watch the men struggle with the question of whether to stay in the village, or to leave for their own safety. it gives a clear insight into the lives of simple monks and how inspiring they can be, despite their fears and frailties. beautifully shot, with wonderful chanting and music throughout, it is a powerful human drama of men under pressure and is highly recommended for anyone seeking a realistic, touching movie experience.", "i know those on the left side of the political spectrum will love this movie and talk about the strength of the monks resolve. answer me this hippies, what benefit does the suicide of these monks give anyone, a true movie of strength would be if these monks found an effective way to fight the muslim extremists. inaction against tyranny equates to endorsement of tyranny. i can appreciate the message about staying true to ones convictions and can respect the motive the execution is where i have issue with this message. good needs to fight evil and there was no fight in this movie. bravery is not exemplified by death for no larger goal. it is a tragic story but once again doing nothing should be recognized just as that.by the way make sure you are well rested when you go see this film as it moves slow, were talking slow like paint drying. nothing happens.", "excerpt, full review at my location - after winning the grand prix at the 2010 cannes film festival, of gods and men has now become france's submission for the best foreign language film at the upcoming oscars. directed by xavier beauvois and based on the true story of seven french trappist monks mysteriously beheaded in algeria in 1996, the film focuses primarily on the events leading up to their deaths.of gods and men is a beautifully made film, eschewing the high drama contained in the source material in favour of quiet contemplation and a celebration of humanity which, although informed by religion, is not defined by it. the calm, quiet direction allows the marvellous individual performances room to take the limelight - and they are thoroughly deserving of it.", "the reviews and recommendations were high for this film, and the awards this film has gathered seem to back that up. taking the plunge to watch this film, i felt as mesmerised as anyone else.this wonderful true tale is about a group of monks living peacefully in a mountain village in algeria along with the community it serves, but are now coming under threat for their lives from extremist terrorists. the monks ponder the questions this poses, stay & risk their lives or escape back to france. or are they the questions? are the questions not really: stay to serve the community they love & cherish or leave them to suffer alone in fear from the terrorists. there are many questions, and you will be emotionally involved with the monks.there is surprisingly little if any melodrama in this film. mostly it is the monks trying to keep their faith and vows, struggling with their conscience and belief in what their fate & role is in the circumstances.beautifully shot and exceptionally well acted by everyone, this film will touch the hearts of all who watch it. it's actually quite a frightening film as we all feel we know what forebodes for these great gentle intelligent men. we empathise fully with them yet watch helpless in their plight.a film for everyone. truly great and truly beautiful.", "xavier beauvois tells the heroic sacrifice of seven missionaries cistercian french in algeria, the victims in 1996 of fundamentalist terrorism, and does so with great sense of proportion, without giving anything to the rhetoric. the film has in fact the rigors of monastic life, the film is stripped, essential, never abundant, as are the dialogues. that of the monks is a path already marked, nevertheless, with some hesitation human, their journey continues up to the extreme coherent. their moral force solidifies in lived experience, which turns into a prolonged spiritual exercise. the earthly life is sacrificed, but there is no complacency in this choice: do not chase and do not suffer, in fact, the appeal of martyrdom, intended only to affirm themselves ideally as free spirits. this is why their example is beyond the scope of religion, within which also mature, but addresses across all men because what it expresses is the need to affirm the value of human dignity and leads to the universal feeling of human solidarity. and 'this is their real strength, the moral freedom of the spirit, the power inherent in each man is to preserve the conscience of each submission.", "incredibly meditative and full of grace. a cinematic prayer. it manages to celebrate both christianity and islam while still telling, in the quietest possible way, a story of extremism. the ease of touch amongst the monks, the weight of their philosophical struggle, the notion of courage derived from their faith and their faith, in turn, derived from their sense of purpose, resonates to the very spiritual core of all things human. it's rare to see belief taken so seriously in art and still have the work transcend the particulars and specifics of any single faith. this is a clean, good, pure act of creativity, uncorrupted by artifice and one of the finest films about religion this atheist has seen in a long time.", "having seen almost all of the oscar nominated films from 2010, and agreeing that the king's speech was an excellent movie, i have to say that this movie is better than any of them.to think that a movie about a group of monks would be unthinkable, and that it is a true story, makes it all that more unbelievable.the quality of the movie and the performances shines through every scene. prepare to be moved and humbled by the film. you will come away feeling spiritually inadequate.a very emotional film about a part of the world we americans know little about, but will resonate with what's going on in northern africa today.everyone, christian, jewish, muslin or any other religion should go see it.", "beautiful film about spiritual discernment...in the times we live in i find it refreshing to watch a group of people rely on the community and the spirit to reach hard decisions. i believe this nonviolent powerful message is vital for our humanity to survive the chaos of modern war...", "of gods and men explores a variety of complex religious themes and ideas through the re-telling of a true story of a group of french monks caught up in the algerian civil war. the film is not a simplistic showcase of good versus evil but is instead a deeply human tale of tolerance, fear and strength. no character falls into the trap of caricature, even the terrorists have depth and motive. the believability of the characters creates a realness that makes the film a more powerful emotional experience. the film begins by introducing us to the monks. the monastery in which they live is a quiet place and their routines consist of tending to the gardens, reading, praying and interacting with the muslim townsfolk. importantly one of the monks, luc (michael lonsdale) acts as the town doctor. the relationship between the monks and the townsfolk is one of mutual respect and friendship. the cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the natural beauty of the landscape and the simplistic beauty of the monastery.the monk's peaceful existence is shaken when word reaches the town that islamist militants are taking over the countryside. the slow pace of the opening half is so calming that when violence breaks out the audience shares the peoples shock and worry. it becomes immediately apparent that the monk's lives are in danger. the monk's world slowly comes crumbling down around their epicentre which is the monastery. the french government and algerian officials urge them to escape while the town's people plead for them not to abandon them. the group of monks is dividend on what decision to make. difficult questions cause repressed raw emotions to bubble to the surface. is it okay to accept help from a corrupt government? when is it acceptable for the sheppard to leave his flock? what good does martyrdom do? the group is rightly afraid and sometimes the fear takes control. lambert wilson (playing christian) delivers a fine performance as a man struggling with leadership in a harrowing situation. the first confrontation scene is truly terrific, with trembling christian putting on a brave face, a combination of fear and determination. it is hard not to be emotional for the second half of the film. the monk's moral presence is felt ubiquitously. in every act of violence or cruelty, whether on screen or off, the monk's sadness permeates from the screen. the honesty of the characters naturally draws the audience's empathy. there is a specific scene which i will not reveal in which the worldly combines with the spiritual that results in one of the most powerful emotional climaxes i have ever seen.i highly recommend viewing this film regardless of one's religious beliefs or background. the film shows both the good that can be achieved through belief as well as the bad. luc quotes pascal to remind us that \"men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction\". the message the film preaches transcends any specific faith as it is one of love, peace, acceptance and harmony.", "this film had me captivated, i could see the interaction between the characters, and how each personality blended with the other to give us the all to sad true story. i have noted that some reviews have pointed out this actor or that, my champion of the group is luc played very well by mr. lonsdale. the scene where he and another are doing the dishes, and having a conversation, luc asks the other a question, which on the surface seems to be in a mocking sense, however it is much deeper, but the other responds, and then leaves. luc understands so much, but does it in his own calm way.thanks to everyone connected with this movie, one of the best. the real monks, perhaps have already said many prayers for those who killed them.rent or buy, do it, you should consider it something you are happy about spending the time to watch.", "something happens to the human heart while experiencing of gods and men: the reminder of our responsibility to not only those we love but also to the betterment of the human condition no matter the cultural differences is overwhelming. would that this film could be required viewing for every global citizen! we might, just might, begin to grow not only more tolerant of other people's beliefs but embrace them as fellow beings and in doing so, end the clangorous need for war. xavier beauvois both wrote (with some assistance from scenarist etienne comar) and directed this film that is as much a work of art as it is a deeply moving story. the film was first released in france as 'des hommes et des dieux' to high acclaim: hopefully it will have the same impact here in this country. based on a true story, the time is in the 1990s, the place algeria during their civil war. a trappist monastery is the home of eight devout elderly monks, each performing the duties to allow them to exist off the land and serve the poverty stricken algerian village near by. the head of the monastery is christian (an elegant and tender lambert wilson), the old physician luc (michael lonsdale) serves the physical needs of the impoverished muslim villagers, and the rest of the monks tend the gardens for food, and study, and rise each morning to begin a day of prayers and masses. these gentle, wise old men are christophe (olivier rabourin), célestin (philippe laudenbach), amédée (jacques herlin), jean-pierre (loïc pichon), michel (xavier maly), and paul (jean-marie frin). a group of terrorists crash the monastery in an attempt to get medicine and food and challenge the 'heretic' monks (the terrorists are islamics), but the strength of the monks and the quiet faith of christian manages to head them off. as the radical islamic terrorists begin killing foreigners the monks must make a decision to flee to safety or remain at their posts as nourishers of the little village they tend. the human side of the monks shows in the fear of survival , but the strength of their faith and their commitment to their people makes the decision to stay unanimous. the fact that the terrorists are islamic is not seen as a difference in their humanity. history has already provided the ending, but the manner in which the monks are driven away from their monastery is not only desperately moving but also uplifting in the manner in which these devoted men face their fate. every actor in this film is an experienced french actor and their performances defy description except to say that to the man they are brilliant. lamber wilson and michael lonsdale are particularly eloquent. the film is in french but with little spoken dialogue: much of the film is the camera (by cinematographer caroline champetier) pausing one the monks at prayer, singing masses, or simply close-up face shots of these well-worn faces. almost every frame of this film could be a renaissance painting. the music for the film is limited to the chanting and singing of masses (breathtakingly beautiful) except for a small but poignant christmas celebration when the monks share a glass of wine form luc and listen to an old tape of tchaikovsky's 'swan lake'. the simplicity of the lives of these trappist monks, their spiritual faith, and their bonding to the villagers they serve and to each other is powerful. understatement rules, especially the indescribably beautiful final scenes as the story disappears into the snowy fog. few films will move the viewer as deeply as this miracle of a film. grady harp", "what a load of boring material, from the trailer it looked like this film was going somewhere, but then i saw the film and was blown away by how little the film had in the way of entertainment. yet another french spoken film, i do not like and think is wishy-washy.a clear do not see, and it pushes me to boredom and tiredness, with a little bit of dosing off.why would anyone give this a good review and an award.a clear 4/10 and that is pushing up the vote to the films maximum, but if you like absolute crap, then this is the film for you.even the acting and direction was lacking as well as the shots, which were boring and usual, nothing to make it stand out, and nothing to give this film merit.", "the french new wave cinema is alive and well, thank you, as evidence by this powerful film.slow and subtle, it gives us a look at community, in this case a community of trappist monks working with poor algerians. they are faced with almost certain death by muslim fundamentalists if they stay, but can they abandon the mission they were sent to do.a look at differences in religious belief is a fundamental of the film. the muslim soldiers cannot fathom the praying over a dead terrorist, but didn't god say to pray for your enemies? the music is amazing and the scenery is spectacular, but it is the agony of decision amidst war that really hits home.superb!", "despite the questioning of the remaining friars, we see the greatest indecision in christian. never verbally explicit by himself, but demonstrated at those times he isolates in the surrounding countryside. in contact with only himself and he to whom he dedicated his life, we never need to hear his existing doubts, for they are expressed through the natural condition represented on those scenes, to the point of the torrential rain illustrating his own inner turmoil.but if he never again speaks his state of mind before the rest of the community after his initial decision, christian demonstrates to his brothers his position. it's not his doubts, but his actions that define him, where opposed to those moments of isolation, he always turns to those who represent his purpose.however, to what extent is his sacrifice worth? they themselves question for whom they do it. and as such, in the letter he wrote earlier but from which the content we just hear at the end, his vision is (for)ever patent. as a souvenir of what put him, them, there. not for themselves or (only) for their faith in god, but for their faith in others, in those who are able to recognise it and, in light of that, remember their own.", "during the algerian civil war (1991-2000) french monks are faced with the decision to leave their monastery or to stay and accept the considerable risks.the risks are not related to the fact that the monks are french or christians. hitherto the monks get along well with the locals, who are moderate muslims. the risks are related to the rise of muslim fundamentalism.the film is rather vague about the motives of the monks. is it only a choice between their own safety and the feeling of letting down the locals when they move? this is the main argument that is made explicit in their discussions.when watching the movie you get the impression that here is another argument that is not made explicit but that is at least as important. the monks have been together for a long time. their is a great internal feeling of loyalty and a big aversion against being spread over various monasteries. in the scene with the communal supper you can almost feel this loyalty.", "\"of gods and men\" is a film that is spiritually appealing on many levels. though it is a faith based movie it does not turn into a sermon on screen, which was refreshing to me. as a christian i find that movies that talk about faith and god frequently turn people off because they get too \"preachy.\" however this film does not. though the monks are faced with some difficult positions through out the movie, they simply embrace the idea that a little faith can get you a long way. \"of gods and men\" also discusses duty. we see that the main struggle that the monks face is that they know what they came to do but when things got hard with all the invasions half of them were ready to leave and go back to france. but after some days they all realized that they feel called to stay, because that is why they came.xavier beauvois is a french actor, film director and screenwriter. his film \"don't forget you're going to die\" was entered into the 1995 cannes film festival where it won the jury prize. for this film, \"of gods and men,\" he received the grand prix and the prize of the ecumenical jury at the 2010 cannes film festival. the film was also selected as france's submission for the academy award for best foreign language film at the 83rd academy awards.after having watched several movies that had either a very limited soundtrack or ones with no sound track at all i found the music in this movie to be tastefully placed. though the movie was slightly dry at times with its lack of interaction between people on a daily basis, i understand that they are monks, the music livened the scenes up a little more. being someone who knows very little about monks and having not been in the best mind set when i watched this movie i found the music to be a relief for the rest of the time spent in silence.also through out the movie viewers are allowed into tranquil moments with the men where viewers see those men in such close, personal space, to where the images are almost unsettling. the movie is filmed to provide viewers the opportunity to get into the lives of the monks. these men lead such private lives that as the movie progresses viewers grow to love them. after the men agree on their final decision the next time they eat is such a touching moment to the viewers because we have seen what each man has struggled with and what each man had to overcome to reach the decision that they did.", "i went to see this film with my 7 yr old son and my priest. he recommended the film to many people at mass. we went and my son, was blown away, entertained, engaged, inspired, just as i did.one may think that our kids would need a film with lots of excitement to keep them engage, but the truth is all they need is a story that touches their hearts.this film is in french with english sub-titles and even with those challenges for a 7 yr old, he enjoyed it and loved the film because the story spoke to his heart.this is one of those gems that one must admire and get inspired with. we need this kind of examples to show how we can co-exist and even love each other despite our beliefs, with respect and love everything is possible! a must must must must watch!!! everyone should watch it because it is so worth it!!!", "a close-to-universal acclaim, a 10-minute standing ovation at the cannes festival and as the most profitable french movie, no one saw 'of gods and men\" coming in 2010, but everyone eventually went to see it.\"of gods and men\" is the cinematically sober yet emotionally powerful chronicle of one of the saddest chapters of the algerian civil war in the 90's: the assassination of seven monks in the atlas mountains by an islamist group that has nothing to envy from today's routinely barbarity that shake the middle east without that generating much reaction. the mention of the context is crucial because any misinformed viewer might misunderstand the story's purpose and take it as another illustration of the islam's innate barbarity. indeed, this is one of these movies that might be appreciated for the wrong reasons.so, it's all to the credit of director xavier beauvois to play fair with the facts and not portray the crime as an isolated one, it's a part of a whole barbaric chain of events that blindly touched the whole of algeria. 1996 and 1997 were perhaps the darkest years of its history as hundreds of thousands of civilians, generally villagers were mercilessly killed and in the most gruesome way, hatchets, throat slit, and so forth. of course, it would take half the review to enumerate the causes of these movements, the mujaheddin in afghanistan sponsored by the cia, and whose faction from algeria had time to make their bones before coming back to algeria, where the cancellation of the islamist party rung like a declaration of war.i think this secretly sponsored extremism is the real core of the problem (look at isis now), more than the tormented post-colonialism relationships. the citizenship of these monks had no more relevance than for the croatian workers who were savagely assassinated under the sight of a poor algerian. the only relevance the algerian war might have is that christian, the prior priest, played by lambert wilson, was a former military, who served in the war and thought he had to stay in order to establish some sort of reconciliation. but xavier beauvois doesn't waste the script to analyze each one's backstory, it's about eight priests who know their lives are at stakes, and must make a choice: leaving or dying.it's a story of an ethical conflict. the monks belong to a cistercian order and they made a vow of stability. the threat is like the test of their own faith. of course, the vow of stability mustn't be at the expenses of their own lives; the sacredness of life, let alone of these eight men, measure up to higher levels than the strict obedience to their vows. but the monks found god in the atlas mountains, they fulfilled their duty by providing medical care to the villagers, michael lonsdale, plays luc, the elderly priest and doctor of the group. they also insist on not interfering with people's faith. in fact, michel is as literate on quran as on the bible.the rest of their time consists on religious chants, prayers and deep contemplation. still, xavier beauvois never tries to make them look pretty on the screen. no traveling or other shots, its mainly steady fixes where all you have to do is contemplate the monks, and watching them, absorbed by their thoughts and their doubts. this is a great choice as it allows the movie to embrace the very lifestyle of their protagonists, and allow us, as viewers to penetrate the moral conflict that drives the narrative. these stoic moments then becomes the foil to more powerful and thrilling scenes where they all discuss whether they should leave because of the threats. and they don't share the same views at all.of course, the film isn't just all talking and contemplation and features many strong interactions with the algerian people, from the military people who asked them to leave for their own good to the terrorists themselves. it's not one of these moments where you're wishing for the good guys to take the right decision, but where you understand what lies behind these very decisions. why does luc give medicine to terrorists? why does he pray for the soul of one of them murderers? why do they ignore the warning of the army, exasperated to see them helping the terrorists? well the answers to these questions are not given, but simply illustrated by their decision to stay. their life has a meaning, and so will their death. it all leads to the point where the monks interpreted the threat as some test from god, as if it gave its full meaning to their presence in algeria. religion is all made of symbols, and they didn't just look at the risks, but at the way they perceived their duty on earth, as if soul-preservation counted more than life. . and that very soul they preserve is of the christ. it's like the mystery of the incarnation finally revealing some of its mysteries. this is one of the few metaphysical moments of the film, but it's immediately followed by its beautiful emotional climax, a last dinner that carries the same resonance as jesus' last supper; with the music of \"swan lake\" in the background.after having kept a restrained tone all through the film, shooting at respectful distance, we finally get the luxury of close-ups and music, as we can see these monks in full faces, smiling and shedding a few emotional tears, not because they just defied barbarity, it's not about proving their worth as soldiers as god, it's not even about testing the empathy required by their faith to its most sincere limit. it's because they're finally in peace with themselves.at a time where you couldn't necessarily triumph in the war against barbarity, you could at least be in peace with yourself, and that was enough a victory.", "this excellent film..a true event is a must for anyone seeking a moral understanding of the human race..the monestary.. situated in a troubled area of algeria during a conflict between the corrupt government and equally corrupt freedom fighters..seems to raise a beacon of hope for goodness within humanity. the heroes,a group mostly elderly monks ,who asked for nothing but to tend to the sick of a nearby village.one monk exhausting himself treating 150 patients a day ..and the medicines they had were always available to all. this included a wounded freedom fighter ..a muslim extremist... at night there chants and prayers would give them strength to carry out there good works.most of them had toiled for decades..they are then advised to leave by the government...however they refuse to desert their flock............. i shall leave it there a great movie for people with a social conscience..enjoy..", "deserved the grand prize of the jury and the ecumenical award at cannes. wonderful performances by lambert wilson and michel lonsdale. a flaw, in my view, was the choice of tchaikovsky's \"swan lake\" played during the beautifully filmed last supper of the monks. also, the opening quote does not appear even remotely in psalms 81 as stated in the film.", "'of gods and men', inspired by a true story, tells of a group of christian monks living in algeria and trying to come to terms with the rise in islamic terrorism, which threatens their way of life and indeed, their chances of even staying alive. but the film is very slow. the beginning is almost impossible to enjoy; once one comes to share a sense of the monks' dilemma, it becomes more interesting, but the pace is still glacial: there are a few visually powerful scenes which overstay their welcome simply by over-extending themselves. the depiction of the monks, and even (in brief glimpses) of the terrorists, is humane, but there's only so many scenes of men signing hymns that a film needs, and this one has too many of them.", "of gods and men is the true story of nine trappist monks living in algeria during the civil war of the 1990s. up to the point of unrest, the catholic clergy men and predominantly muslim population lived mostly in harmony until islamic fundamentalists arrive in the area. the man in charge of the monastery, christian, takes a vote of his group and they decided to stay and hope to convince the religious fanatics of the morality of getting along despite their religious differences. the brave men of true faith and compassion were just pawns in a conflict between a corrupt army and even worse government. the filming was done at a benedictine monastery which had been closed for forty years and was made to appear as accurate as possible to the real monastery. it is a beautiful and serene setting and the acting is tremendous by the entire cast. gregorian chants are sung at various points and add a mystical and authentic feel to the film. of gods and men is a tragic but necessary warning to the world of the dangers of fanaticism.", "i won't say that this film will change your life. such a line, a cliché, invites disappointment. i will instead say that it may make you want to change your life.co-written by the director, xavier beauvois, and based upon real life events, the story of a small band of monks in algeria who resist the urge to flee to safety when civil war comes calling, each man wrestling with his fears, passing through a dark night of the soul. the cast is led by lambert wilson, unrecognisable as the same actor who played the foppish merovingian in matrix reloaded, and michael lonsdale (moonraker, the name of the rose, munich), and there are a couple of faces recognisable from other things (e.g. engrenages). the movie's musical interludes come in the form of monastic chanting and singing by the monks themselves.the monks live in harmony alongside the impoverished villagers. life is peaceful except for all those little differences and details. what does it mean to be in love asks one young woman of brother luc (lonsdale). then, suddenly, violence bursts in upon the villagers' routines, and soon the politicians are telling the monks they should depart and return to france, since they refuse the army's protection. brother christian (wilson) must lead them but as first among equals, amongst brothers. should they stay, or go, and if go then where? the war comes to their door and it is the - what are they, insurgents, rebells? - fundamentalists who prove to be the more reasonable and less scary men of blood. the army, when they come calling, exude contempt, even towards the villagers.monk: we are like birds on the branch. perhaps we will not go.villager: no you are the branch, we the birds. if you go we lose our footing.of gods and men (2010) manages to dramatise spiritual struggle and personal courage without bombast and without boredom, but needless to say a film about monks in north africa won't be for everyone. it's fascinating to watch how christian is able to appeal to both those brothers who are doubting and afraid and also to the armed men who are themselves brothers likewise, according to their own book. perhaps it is politics that ruins all?", "don't know about high rating but i found the movie to be very very slow and boring could have watched a decent documentary. in the beginning i felt its promising but twenty minutes into it i felt sleeping, through out i did not understand what was going on except i loved the country side location. frankly this can be said one of the silent movie which demonize only community & praise other by no word spoken but the sub consciously accept it. the monk are helping villagers, they are humble, religious, peace ful but they are few numbers of monks but indirectly it portraits christians on the other hand few sepratarists are made to represent islam around the world but in reality the community the monk represent is reason for major conflicts in muslim world, they are the reason because of which not only few number of villagers but millions of civilians lives are devastated. i feel the movie does not serve any purpose.", "from my point of view, i think it would be a good movie if it were not so repetitive. the sequences are repeated and the same sequences are repeated again. it does not advance. there comes a time when you think about passing it on. what happens is that as you are going to make a criticism, you do not.he has a great cast of actors. they tell when they talk and when they do not, the problem is that they are a long time to count.the film tells very well that difficult decision between what they think as people and what they think as monks.this casting is very well chosen since they are all elderly.if it had lasted for forty minutes less would be much better.although i do not like photography or planning. except the end if you have a good picture.it really seems like you're in the middle of a war. the atmosphere is very good.the problem is that i get very long", "in screenwriting, it is drilled into you that you must have these five basic elements to achieve a good story. this 2 hour movie had monks praying, monks singing, monks working...repeat. there were some long scenes that made me wonder why on earth they were included. i consider myself devout. i feel a certain endearment toward the lives of devout men and women, but this simply was not an enjoyable movie.", "delicate pledge for tolerance. splendid poem about love, sacrifice and force of faith. but basic virtue remains the measure of image, dialog, acting. it is not a film about a catholic monastery community, it is not about politic or terrorism. its subject is far to be complicated. it is the existence as puzzle of decisions and sacrifice. nothing more. nothing else. sure, the presence of michael lonsdale or lambert wilson, the hymns, atmosphere, the christian lesson without any thesis demonstration, jacques herlin who remembers the silhouette of abbe pierre are important bricks for film. but essence is the feeling of viewer. the subtle emotion. because it is a film about daily reality. and inspired answers to its challenges.", "based on a true story about monks realizing their end is near at the height of the algerian civil war in the 1990s, of gods and men, won the cannes film festival's coveted best film prize, so i went with heightened anticipation of a meaningful experience. not so much.i have never seen more amazing casting of amazing faces that move me. each monk's face told a story, but i never got to hear what it was. two monks, brother christian and the medic, brother luc, had stories which we got to learn but not experience. christian was a scholar of the quran, and luc was a medic who healed the muslims from the village, whom he clearly loved. but the others looked like they had amazing stories, but never got to share them. the way the cinematographer held the camera in a close-up of each of the monks for a very, very, long time, over and over again, made for an amazing set of portraits that would have been great as an exhibit in a museum or gallery, but it never came together as a film. i kept thinking that annie leibovitz would have loved the opportunity to shoot them, but she would have given their hard-life lines some sort of context. as far as the acting went, my feeling was that the director kept saying, \"walk slower or look earnestly to left of camera.\" like the portraits of the monks, each scene was shot in a still life set up that made you feel like you were in a fabulous museum with amazing artists, but the director never brought them all together into a story. the religious scenes of prayer and celebration were just too long and drawn out. and don't tell me you were trying to make the point that a good chunk of daily time went into the routines that make monks monks. i know that, but you can't shove it down my throat that way.please don't get me wrong. it's worth seeing, just for the amazing shots and faces. but don't expect to understand anything about what was happening during that tumultuous time, and don't expect to walk away really feeling like there was a point to it all.i am beginning to think that if you do something different, and shoot it really, really well, then you can win lots of awards. dialogue matters in a film. it's part of the weave that makes a story, and it was sorely missing in of gods and men. to win cannes with no dialog says, \"shame on cannes.\" and the same can be said of the plot. you knew from the get-go what was going to happen, and they just took a long time to tell you that you had it right from the opening scene."]}

of those movies about a stranger that blows into a conservative town and teaches everyone to loosen up and let go of their inhibitions. except now it's a kids movie about a chaotic little girl so unstoppable she's basically magic.it's an extremely, extremely simple movie, full of actors trying to do their best impressions of living cartoon characters. it's over an hour of kids just... playing around, upsetting adults, and defying just about every physical and natural law on earth.it's not the worst idea, but it's a lot of fluff. and i mean a lot. it goes down a lot easier when you're younger.and the thing is, my memories from being a kid lead me to remember a lot more about the first half of the movie than the second half, because eventually it realizes it's run out of road. the last 20-30 minutes are practically a completely separate movie.i may have been a bit bored, but honestly, i can't be too upset about it. it's not pippi's fault. i'm hardly this movie's target audience anymore, and at the bare minimum, it's nice to revisit these memories. there was a version of me that loved this movie, and it's good to get in touch with that once in a while.", "there are many possible reactions to this curious adaptation of astrid lindgren's classic children's books, with most reactions being a bit polarized on the \"liked it\" or \"hated it\" scale. this review will hopefully be a non-polarized summary for those who are interested in finding out more about this movie.this adaptation is true to the spirit of lindgren's books (though it is set in america rather than sweden), faithfully recreating the plucky, wildly pigtailed pippi longstocking and her endearing anarchy at the villa villekulla, complete with her horse, her monkey, her gold coins, her \"whopper\" tales, her superhuman strength, and her constant besting of adults. though a bit old-looking for the role of a (supposedly) nine-year-old girl, tami erin does manage to capture pippi's spunk, mischief, and childlike appeal.the curious aspect of the film comes in the form of its incongruously modern-sounding songs, playing against a 1950s backdrop (though the songs are quite catchy), as well as a slightly choppy narrative, with several abrupt scene changes that make certain sections of the movie seem somewhat incomplete. there is a silly, cartoon-style feel to parts of the movie, though other parts are quite amusing.it is a g-rated movie in the first sense, with absolutely nothing inappropriate (though do keep in mind that pippi can do anything she wants, including climbing all over the roof of her house), and its fine supporting cast of adults include dennis dugan as the ever-exasperated father of neighbors tommy and annika, john schuck as pippi's father, and eileen brennan, who is her usual hilarious self as the stuffy head of the orphanage.the most curious thing about this film is that, in spite of its little oddities, you find yourself feeling quite happy when the film is over. i was eight years old when the movie came out in 1988, and i absolutely adored it at the time. after all, pippi gets to do all the things that children wish they could do if they knew they could get away with it. though there is a slight 80s quality to the film, it seems to hold up fairly well, and can still be seen on video shelves at major retail stores, which says something about its appeal these decades later. it is a children's film (as opposed to a family film), which means it will greatly appeal to, of course, children. . .or children-at-heart. but since that is the essence of pippi herself, then the film seems to hit the mark.", "while i freely admit that this is not technically a great movie, i like it. i liked the music and pippi's bravery. it's not meant to be watched critically, witha fine-tooth comb.when i watch it, i feel ten years old again, and that's what it's all about. :)", "i remember seeing this one 12 years ago, i loved it (i think it was my favorite movie) of course i was only 5 or 6 but then again thats the age group the film was made for.id really like to get my hands on this one for nostalgic reasons but its just to old.", "this is another north east florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to fernandina beach and the kingsley plantation. i was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of fernandina beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. the film is pretty, and pretty bad. tami erin is cute, but overacts. eileen brennan overacts even more. good for small kids, or for those who like fluff in large doses. a 4 from the miller-movies formula.", "when they were growing up, my kids latched onto this film. they probably watched it thirty times. i could hear it in the background until the tunes were stuck in my head. it is a musical with songs that are not all that sophisticated. the story is simplistic. but it is for kids. pippi is played by a young lady named tami erin. she does a decent job as the weird daughter of a sea captain that has arrived at an old house, along with a horse and a monkey. of course, she gravitates toward the neighbor kids whose parents immediately see her as a bad influence. she is a child, living a world of rules and regulations. soon the cold blooded authorities swoop in. it's all pretty formula but there are nice scenes and she does kind of sparkle.", "this movie . . . i don't know. why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin, i will never know. why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, then not bother to edit it properly, i will never know. why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period, and sometimes bizarrely not, why they commissioned such bad songs, why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever (not even on a silly, children's film level) . . . . what were they thinking?? nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. every single part is dubbed (and always poorly,) every sound effect is slightly wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren's creation.", "it's funny i see adults come in and rip a movie like this. they rip kids cartoons, and kids movies as being \"unrealistic and insane and cheesy\", well hello it's for freaking kids! they didn't make it for some 25 or older person who wants to complain about every kids movie! i watched this movie when i was 12 and i really enjoyed it! the different \"magical\" stunts they did, the music (i loved the music) and the likes. still a good movie for kids of today. as long as you're 12 or under you'll enjoy this movie.", "kiddy movie about a spirited redhead named pippi longstocking who's separated from her sea captain father in a storm and comes to live in a small town. there she introduces the kids to her madcap ways while dealing with stuffy adults and some thieves. okay this is meant for kids and only kids, so let's keep that in mind before ripping it apart. i know it's corny and cheesy and i can't say that i enjoyed it very much, but i think i might have if i had seen it when i was a child. i am old enough to have seen this when it was first released but, for some reason, i didn't. truth is i forgot this movie even existed until recently catching it on tv. the cast all does fine, particularly tami erin as pippi. not recognizing her, i looked at her other roles and saw this was the biggest part in her limited acting career. i also saw that she did a sex tape a few years ago. i can only imagine that is either deeply disturbing or extremely exciting to people who were fans of her back in the day. aside from tami, there's some solid support from vets like eileen brennan, dick van patten, and john schuck. there are also many songs in this but none is more catchy than the theme song that's repeated throughout the movie. i want to warn you in advance, this song will find a corner of your brain to inhabit and it will be impossible to get it out. overall, it's a fun little movie that will play better to pre-teen girls than anybody else. just be prepared that it's pretty sugary and corny. oh, and that theme song will stay in your brain forever.", "i'm a 59 yr old man who watched this movie with his grandkids. we all enjoyed it immensely.it had everything it should have for a movie that was based on fantastic events. a little girl who had super natural powers, a sea captain ( her father) who was the king of a cannibal tribe, a horse who to some extent could talk, at least well enough that pipi could umderstand him.there was also a flying motorcycle, and a flying machine that pipi powered by twirling around with a broom.i wouldn't have enjoyed it near as much, had my grand kids not been there to ooh, ahh, and giggle, at what was taking place. it was a very enjoyable movie, and well worth spending my time watching. if you have kids to watch it with, it will be that much more enjoyable.", "pippilotta longstocking is a preteen daughter of a pirate who sails around the world. as pippi explains, there's only about 8 places she hasn't seen. but, one day, a storm blows pippi and the boat away from her father and their temporary port of call. she decides to head to their hometown and the old house the family has owned for a long time. kids believe the house is haunted, it's been empty for ages. soon, neighbor kids tommy and annika discover pippi and make friends. she shows them lots of new games, like scrubbing the floor in special shoes. also, they give out ice cream to the children at the orphanage. most of the parents are appalled with pippi, her pets, and her lack of supervision. the head of the children's home - eileen brennan - sends men to bring pippi to the place she runs. but, as pippi is far stronger and smarter than the average child, she eludes capture. will her father come to find her? this film, based on the outstanding swedish author astrid lindgrens books.for kids, is acceptable viewing for families. pippi has a unique look with her freckles and protruding braids while her zany actions make for laughs. but, if you watch it, be sure to extend the pleasure by getting the books and reading them together. the books are classics while this flick is just ok.", "what a horrible thing to do with astrid lingrens work.the actors are 4th grade amateurs. it hurts my stomach to hear them read the script. because that's what it sounds like. unlike the earlier swedish productions. they were kinda amateurs, but did a great job. i hope no one ever insults astrid (and pippi) again. and the singing is horrible. the songs are forgettable at best. i am trying to find the originals dubbed. that must be much better. shame on you for making this horrible thing.americanizing things isn't always a good thing. how come they always think \"we can do it better\" it rarely is.", "this movies is great fun for kids considering some of the garbage that is on tv these days. the kids love pippi's outlook on life and her dream in believing that you can do what you set your heart on. she is a girl who believes in herself and looks for the good in others. kids could do worse.", "this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988. it looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier, and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture. i weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this.", "i remember seeing this when i was eight years old and at the time i really liked this film. kids today i'm sure will still appreciate the zany antics of the pigtailed troublemaker. it's a typical kiddie film but it's something that parents may not might mind watching with the kids unlike say barney the dinosaur or teletubbies. -bkj", "'the new adventures of pippi longstocking' is a film starring the popular pippi, a fun-loving girl who tries to see the good in everything around her and have fun. it has been a long time since i saw this film, but i did like it when i was younger. it was not my favourite, but i thought that it was fun because pippi is very enthusiastic about life and it is a generally feel-good children's film. i last watched this film when i was about eight-years-old. i think that children around that age will enjoy the film as it is upbeat but a generally good film about a fun-loving girl hero with a positive outlook on life.", "just finished watching jewel of the nile and before i could shut off the tv and go to bed at a semi-reasonable hour, pippi came on. somehow, i got sucked into the movie and now over here to imdb. maybe it was the catchy tunes or wanting to find out if the cute kids in the movie ever went on to star in anything noteworthy (none did, except the head girl who i didn't like).i'm in my 30s, have no kids, and have never read the books or seen any other pippi books. guess what? i enjoyed it a lot! sure. it's goofy, doesn't always make sense, is anachronistic at times, and is not serious cinematography. but i liked it.the music was cheerful, the songs were uplifting and arguably one of the best parts of the movie. the kids were great, too. it's sad that the actress playing pippi didn't go on to do more work (especially if it had been more age-appropriate... hard to imagine she was only 10). she did a really fine job. i also got a kick out of seeing dick van patten in his bit part.the monkey was probably the worst actor in the film, but since they probably paid him peanuts (and bananas), they probably didn't waste any money.the flying machine was totally unrealistic, but it is a kids movie. the cleaning of the floors was probably the best scene in the movie.it was just good clean fun that i would be happy to let my kids watch (if i had any), and the songs are way better than barney's. :-) people who object to the film have just left their childhood senses of wonder long behind. they don't believe pippi when she says that you can do just about anything if you believe in it.", "i'll be the first to admit that this film is light-hearted and often silly. after all, the pippi books are silly and light-hearted, so why shouldn't a movie version be? the character of pippi is a great character study for kids: she is imaginative, creative, confident and above all, a good-willed and courteous child. anyone who expects her and the stories she stars in to be methodical depictions of the serious side of life should re-examine his/her life and priorities. maybe then the detractors will realize that life can be fun, at all ages.", "i highly recommend this film for any family with children. this is a top quality production that is great for the whole family to watch! anyone who i have ever met who has seen this movie loves it, and children who have it on vhs or dvd watch it over and over again. i only wish it was re-released theatrically, so that this generation of children could have the opportunity to see it and embrace it the way i did when i was a child.", "this movie contains all the necessary elements that make up a great movie. the storyline - it's about pippi!, that's enough! the americans succeeded not only in translating astrid's wonderful creation, but made changes and improvements also. since i never heard of astrid objecting, we can assume that she was in agreement. fine acting, most notably branscombe ricmond who, according to my sources, was given a starring role in the hit tv series \"renegade\" largely because of the skills he demonstrated in this pippi movie. special effects - though never elaborated upon, pippi is possessed of superhuman physical powers. she can, for example, lift persons and horses that outweigh her in multiples, dry herself and fly by some sort of self induced centrifugal force! fine directing - mr annakin seems to keep things on track. there's even innuendos, pippi proclaims that she \"...loves men in uniforms, but policemen are the best!\" fine music - catchy tunes throughout the movie which have often been emulated in other movies. it has been said that tami erin could have sang the title song as inger had in the original pippi movies, but the powers that were wanted her to concentrate solely upon her acting role, except for shorter tunes which did not require as much diversion. and finally mystery - tami erin, our star, for reasons still unknown, was never heard from again. this movie is worth watching over and over again.", "it seems like i'm one of the few americans who read translations of the pippi longstocking books, and saw this movie as a kid. at this point, i can't remember what came first for me, the books or the movies, but i will say that as a child, i enjoyed both.pippi is a great character in literature, i could consider her arguably one of the greatest female characters ever created.she's strong, she's independent, she's fun, intelligent and gifted.what girl wouldn't want to be like pippi? i know that reading about her as a little girl, i was endlessly jealous of tommy and annika who got pippi as a playmate. i wished she'd move next door to me.this movie doesn't do such a great job of translating the pippi character. she seems less creative and imaginative, and more crazy and dim. there's something about the character of pippi that is lacking in the movie and the movie loses a lot because of that.but pippi aside, the movie isn't all bad. it's a late 80's kids movie with cheesy special effects, poor acting, and a silly story. but through all this, it is still enjoyable. the situations that pippi and tommy and annika get in are still fun, and it's a good movie for young kids. if you do show this movie to your kids though, be sure to buy them the books afterwards and show them what pippi is really like. this movie is a good starting point to get kids introduced to the great character of pippi.", "someone loosed an ancient redheaded demon named pipi longstocking. her powers come from her ginger mane. she has super strength, flight, teleportation and illusion. if pipi comes to your town run. chaos is here!", "most of the people commenting on this movie sound like they all some big shot film critics and have to critique every aspect of this film! this is a childrens movie! it is not meant for anyone over the age of say 12!! if you are older, and like it, great, but if you dont, then dont say its bad because you have no basis for judging it the way a child would!i grew up with pippi, me and my sister have seen this movie along with the original... many many times, and we have always loved it!this is a fun movie for kids, yes thats right... kids, people who dont care about over-acting, or cheesy music, to them its fun and fun to sing along to... personaly, i am 18 now, and i still think the music is kinda catchy! if you think this movie is so terrible, why dont you try seeing the reactions of children when they are watching it... cause i guarantee you 100% that they will enjoy it totally!", "i've always liked astrid lindgrens children's books very very much, and watched the original swedish tv-series of pippi over and over again (with dutch subtitles). i think the swedish girl (inger nilsson) who played pippi in the original version was way better then this annoying american teenager pretending to be all cute and 10 years old! true, the original series look rather out of date now (being filmed in the 1970's), but for me, that always added a kind of innocense and charm to it. and the horse and monkey were not supposed to talk! why add such \"it's a kiddy movie, so all animals are fluffy and can speak\" nonsense to an already great story ?the only possible justification i can think of for \"improving\" the swedish series like this is that the original tv-series isn't available in the us. maybe american kids like this new version, but i will surely never watch this crap again! i still have some of the original episodes on tape, and my cousins still laugh every time they watch them (despite the lousy special effects and the subtitles)!i give this terrible rip-off 1 star out of 5 (maybe kids who don't know the books or the swedish version like it)", "this is a movie i saw a million times growing up and it shaped my life as it is now. to this day, i clean my house a little differently than most people... pippi's outlook on life as a game to be played, every one around her as a friend to be made, make her not only unique, but a role model.i mean, her look is so distinctive, kids still dress up as her for halloween, and this movie is how old now? that alone should render it a classic.", "i loved this movie as a kid, and i still love to watch it from time to time. it makes me feel like a kid again whenever i watch it. it brings back that feeling of magic being real.now, my nieces love it as well and watch it with me every now and then, and i hope that they share it with their children one day. it is definitely a movie to be passed on from generation to generation.anyone who wants their children to grow up with a sense of adventure and wonder or a belief in the impossible should watch this movie with their children. as an adult, it will also bring back your own sense of wonder.", "i remember enjoying the pipi longstocking books in elementary school, and my 4-year-old loves this movie. as an adult, however, i find it painful to watch. it isn't that the movie is bad, at least not in the same sense that schlocky sci fi and horror movies are bad. the children do acceptable acting jobs, although the adult actors are lackluster. the sets, costumes, and special effects are adequate. the music is bouncy. there are lots of fun pipi stunts and much childhood wish fulfillment. all good, clean fun. somehow, though, the film is less than the sum of its parts.i think it must be the plotting and pacing. the super-competent pipi so outmatches her opponents -- a villainous real estate agent and an uncompassionate human services worker -- that you never feel any suspense or concern for her safety. in fact, pipi comes across as such a smart-mouthed brat that i began to sympathize with her playmates' whiny father. the story itself meanders from incident to unrelated incident until the movie positively drags.so, this is a movie that it is safe to let your kids watch unsupervised. that's a good thing, because you won't want to sit through it yourself, at least not more than once.", "my daughter and i recently enjoyed the new adventures of pippy longstocking (1988) on tubi. the story follows pippy and her dad, who, after a lifetime of sea adventures, faces a thunderstorm that leaves him lost at sea. pippy arrives home and attempts to integrate into society while anxiously awaiting her dad's safe return.this picture is directed by ken annakin (the longest day) and stars tami erin (disconnect), eileen brennan (clue), dick van patten (spaceballs), bridget brno (the haunted mansion) and branscombe richmond (the scorpion king).this movie held a special place in my childhood, often watched on hbo before heading to school. the imaginative circumstances, perfect sets, and characters make it a captivating experience. tami erin shines as pippy, and eileen brennan portrays a captivating villain. the lively monkey and horse add a wild touch, creating a peter pan magical atmosphere. there are hints of oliver twist, with smart twists and turns leading to a heartwarming conclusion. this film has everything one could ask for.in conclusion, the new adventures of pippy longstocking is a carefree kids' classic that's a must-see. i would give it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.", "after her father's ship is carried off by a sudden storm, the spunky pippi longstocking is stranded with her horse, alfonso, and monkey, mr. nilsson, and takes up residence in the old family home, which is thought by neighborhood children to be haunted. soon, two children, tommy and annika, venture into the house only to meet up with pippi. the three soon become friends and get into various adventures together, including cleaning the floor with scrubbing shoes, dodging the \"splunks\", going down a river in barrels, and helping pippi with the problem of having to go to a children's home. older children will probably get the most out of this movie.", "the new adventures of pippy longstocking movie is an amazing classic! when i was little i wanted to be just like pippy! she has amazing adventures and is so caring and shows it in the movie. this movie has a great story line and is very touching. it make make you happy, laugh, cry and get upset.pippy longstocking helps everyone out she can, even if she get into trouble. this is a movie you can watch over and over with family and kids of all ages. i wish the made more sequels of this movie i would of definitely watched them. the actors are so great in keeping character that you can love or really dislike one and get really into the movie.", "i remember renting this movie on vhs as a kid in 1990. it was fun and i never forgot about it. i recently watched it again as an adult and i have to say that i still enjoy it for what it's worth.it's a childhood fantasy of freedom, imagination, responsibility, confidence and independence. it's about girl power and supportive friendships. it's set in a time where there are several elements that would be unheard of nowadays. the children in this film don't need child services or social interventions. there are scenes in this film that no child (or adult) could get away with today and that's all part of the retro-fun. it speaks to the desire of everyone's inner child for complete freedom and living only in days of fun and free living... and there's nothing wrong with that in a children's story. i genuinely enjoyed watching this movie again and i'm giving it a high score for being more original than the computer animated children's movies of today.", "i've seen this movie only twice: the first time i saw it was in the theater in 1988 with a friend when we were in elementary school, then i saw it on tv a couple of years later. the theme song is still annoying over a decade later!!! this film did not do the wonderful pippi storybooks a shred of justice. eek!!!", "i loved it when i was six to twelve! i don't understand how these people can go on and on about how the plot is stupid or the songs are awful. it's a movie for kids! they enjoy (i still love it!) and everyone i know who saw it as a child loved it!", "i myself grew up with the wonderful swedish pippi movies(dubbed, i've seen them in dutch and in german), which are so popular that they are still repeated today. and i also know the books(infact i've read most of astrid lindgren's books, well the ones that where translated in dutch).since those movies where made in the 70's i wondered what this movie would be like.now i'm not the targeted agegroup anyomore, but i didn't like this version. pippi was much too fake. also everything seemed very fake come to think of it, it had none of the magic the origional films had.so if you've read the books and wanna see a film, please try and find the swedish ones they are great!", "words cannot even explain how boring, annoying, and just straight out awful this movie is. i was forced to watch this in third grade, and when i heard that the class was going to watch it again, i took a sick day because this is so terrible, but that didn't stop me from seeing the movie again. the teacher made me watch it on tape. i had my fingers over my ears the whole time. the voices sound worse than nails on a chalk board. they voices are all squeaky with a country accent.and the only reason i \"remember\" is 1, because it was so bad, and 2, i searched it on you tube to see if it was either my short 3rd grade temper, or that the movie was actually terrible. and the answer was that the movie is not terrible, but so annoying that you would rather do almost anything than watch this whole movie.just stay away from this \"movie\", for your own mental state.", "one of the very worst productions ever, \"the new adventures of pippi longstocking\" is one of those films that makes you scratch your head so hard that your hair nearly falls out. the titled character (the annoying and unwanted tami erin) is basically a female version of \"peter pan\" who just cannot seem to grow up or make much sense. she befriends two equally dim-witted children her age and they spend the duration of the film doing a whole bunch of nothing for the most part. eileen brennan (what in the world was she thinking?) is also on hand as a mean social worker who wants erin to go to a foster home. i would have to be with erin on that one, who would want her? turkey (0 stars out of 5).", "yeah this may be an \"80's\" movie, but it still has that fun for the whole family. i watched this when i was younger and loved it. now my daughter watches it too. she loves it too. pippi is hilarious and the songs are funny. plus they get stuck in your head! but i would recommend this for any parent that needs a movie for their kids to watch.", "ah, another member of the 100 worst club! at this point i've already seen batman & robin, can't stop the music, cool as ice, dungeons and dragons, and about 10 more, so it's about time i saw another one. and trust me, pippi longstocking is pretty yucky. one of my friends loves it because she watched it constantly as a child, but i couldn't help but laugh at most of this movie. the special effects are very obvious, especially when anyone gets thrown great distances (uh, wire work, anyone?). and for some reason we're supposed to believe that pippi is this magical child, but half of her 'magical' abilities are simple flips and cartwheels that any gymnast could pull off. but, i admit, few children could make a plane fly just by telling it to go up or pick up a grown man and hurl him into a tree. the songs are patently 80s, and stuck in my head for way too long (maybe because my friend knew them by heart and sung along!). then there is the title character herself, who comes off less sympathetic as she does bratty and simple minded. she has the attention span of a knat, never listens to anyone and for some reason that makes her adorable? uh, i'm gonna go with a \"no\" there, alex. but for all its glaring faults, pippi is not pure evil like some flicks i've watched (dungeons & dragons, anyone?). i got my revenge, though, because after we watched this i made my friend watch can't stop the music from start to finish. talk about your torture sessions! i give pippi a respectable 1.5/4 stars."]}

(didn't bother me, though ) most importantly, this film does not contain a single fart joke nor any talking animals or even animal sidekicks (except for those singing frogs you might have seen in the trailers, but they're really not the same thing). i don't know how close this adaptation is to william joyce's novel \"a day with wilbur robinson\", as i've never read anything joyce has written, but it all works pretty well and manages to be an exiting and entertaining family adventure movie.one aspect of the movie that works particularly well is the design. the buildings, machines and landscapes of the future really look totally cool and have a very own look that is inspired by joyce's illustrations and various visions of the future from the 50ies and 60ies. they're beautifully rendered, too. furthermore, the animation is pretty awesome. the movements of the quirky characters are very fast but funny and cleverly stylized. the best example for this is the bowler hat guy who moves in a unique style that makes him look like a giant spider. this really is a welcome change from the hyper-realistic motion capturing stuff we've been seeing in a lot of movies lately. the character design isn't so bad either. however, the humans don't look quite as good as the ones in the incredibles, the stylization of some characters makes them look a little too artificial for my taste. the voice-acting, which relies on solid voice actors and luckily doesn't involve any fancy stunt casting, leaves nothing to be desired. danny elfman's score is pretty fine, too. i could have done without the cheesy pop songs that were played at some parts of the film, though.altogether, i highly recommend seeing this warmhearted family film to any animation fan. it might not be as good as my pixar favorites the incredibles and finding nemo, but it sure is a lot better than most of the other studios' wisecracking-and-farting-animal flicks. with pixar's john lasseter pulling the strings at disney's animation unit now, they finally seem to be getting back on the right track and i'm looking forward to their next projects, especially the traditionally animated the frog princess.one last thing: as some of you might have heard, disney wants to start putting original animated shorts in front of their feature films again. meet the robinsons kind of makes a start by showing the old mickey, donald & goofy short boat builders in the beginning. it's a great experience to see one of those on the big screen again and the kids in the audience apparently loved it.", "from the second dark age of disney the movies were rather hit or miss. most of them lacked the same creative spark and wit of earlier productions, but once they hit rock bottom with the embarrasing home on the range and the ugly mean spirited chicken little they steadily rose from the ashes.despite having a pacing problem i wil not consider meet the robinsons a bad movie, because it's definitely more good-natured that aforementioned chicken little. the message is about believing in yourself and keeping your head up even when things seem hopeless. its message isn't sugar coated or hammered in so credits to the writers for getting that right.but yeah, as well intentioned as it might be, the pacing problem takes away the final punch that could make the movie a forgotten gem, but we get so many characters and jokes thrown at us from time to time that we don't get to know the side characters fully.but overall a good expirience. underrated? yes. masterpiece? no. but it has its moments which makes it worth your time.", "i saw an advance screening of 'meet the robinsons' today with the family and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. after getting a bit sick of recent cgi animal flicks (with the possible exception of flushed away), this was a refreshing change.an intriguing storyline revolves around orphan lewis who, as a 12-year old, is an up-and-coming inventor, and dreams of building a time machine to find out who his mother was. he meets a mysterious boy wilbur robinson who tries to save him from the equally mysterious man with the bowler hat. we are then drawn into a time travel story that, while having as many paradoxes as back to the future, ends with some interesting plot twists.we saw the movie in 3d - and while there were a few \"especially for 3d\" visual effects, such as flying food - the 3d was not overdone and did not detract from the story.", "lewis is an 12-year-old orphan who is always inventing things. however, in a science fair, he meets wilbur, a 13-year-old boy from the future who is chasing after a bowler hat man who came to the past to steal lewis' invention, a machine that shows memories. when he steals it, wilbur takes lewis to the future, as wilbur explains he is chasing the villain due to him stealing a time machine. this would lead to an adventure where lewis meets wilbur's family, the robinsons, and stop the bowler hat man from changing the future.this is a horribly underrated film. the characters are actually enjoyable, especially the members of wilbur's family, from uncle art, the galactic pizza delivery guy voiced by the late adam west, to tiny the t-rex, each character has an unique personality and talent. also, the film is beautifully animated and teaches a lesson: keep going forward, despite your failures. this is worth checking out.", "\"meet the robinsons\" it's a good animated movie that coursed correct disney animation studios, after a series of miss hits.the story has some great messages and the overall movie had some good characters. but it was away from being great! the animation looks like is a different studio's production and the art decoration is rather pour.not to be negative, i recommend this one to every family and every animation lover, it's just not the best thing you will ever witness.", "this is a movie like big hero 6. it is full of fun and wonder, i wish they had done a second. love it :)", "i just saw this film on 25th of march with the 3d glasses in an advanced screening here in australia. this film is extremely colorful and will send a powerful message to kids (keep moving forward). im 21 years old and i wouldn't say there is much in this for adults, there is the odd joke here and there but it isn't the sort of \"shrek\", \"toy story\" movie where it is for everyone.the story follows a young boy (lewis) who is left at an orphanage practically from birth. he grows up with a passion to invent things. day in and out he fails and never gets adopted but never gives up. as the movie goes on we find his main dream is to invent a time machine to find out who is mother was. at a science fair when he finally gets an invention to work (that shows what you are thinking on a tv in a particular period of time) a young boy, wilbur, shows up and insists he is from the future and to watch out for \"bowler hat guy\". anyway this bowler hat guy destroys lewis' invention before he has a chance to show anyone and from there wilbur gets lewis to travel to the future with him, closely followed by the \"bowler hat guy\" and the movie then takes a turning point.cgi (animation) - this is hard to judge here as i viewed the entire movie in 3d glasses, which i haven't done before, however the animation was very similar to that of jimmy neutron: boy genius and was decent but not really anything new or groundbreaking. definitely not up to pixar's high standards.a lot of the jokes in this movie felt as if they were trying to be funny rather then funny but the dinosaur (i'm sure most of you have seen him in the trailer) and the \"bowler hat guy\" really steal the show. the \"bowler hat guy\" was quite dimwitted and really clueless yet still remained the ultimate bad guy. he reminded me of doctor octopus from spiderman in that he is controlled by another object (in this case a flying hat) the title suggests that you will get to know this entire 'whacky' family from the future but you really only get to know wilbur and never any of the other characters at all as we don't meet them until half way in the film (we get a 2 minute quick introduction which is fun but never goes anywhere else).overall this was a good movie for kids but i don't think it will appeal to anyone over 20-25 like other cgi movies. it was quite fast paced, excellent animation and an admirable main character but as mentioned above it doesn't really get anywhere, the plot does buildup rather well but never really takes off. still a pretty good, colorful movie for kids with a decent story and a positive message behind it. other than that there isn't much new here but still a lot of fun to be had in its own right.", "i went to the theater this afternoon to catch an r-rated film and goofed on the times. the only movie available in my time frame allowed was meet the robinsons. i reluctantly bought a ticket and was pleasantly rewarded with a movie experience that reminded me very much of my childhood. when we got to go to the movies in the 50's and 60's, there were trailers, followed by the newsreel and then a cartoon before the main attraction. the non-three d version started with non-r rated trailers, followed by a mickey mouse cartoon (loved it!) and then the main feature. it was very entertaining to sit back and relax and not worry about the good guys dying, the amount of slaughter that would be portrayed, or that there wouldn't be a positive message at the end. as an adult, there were enough references to keep me entertained and from the sounds of the kids in the theater, they were obviously enjoying this movie. i would highly recommend it to all but the crankiest movie-goers, and i personally loved the quote from uncle walt at the end of the movie. when i was little, our whole family watched walt disney every sunday and i particularly remember when it changed to walt disney's wonderful world of color. walt disney was a man ahead of his time and i really miss his adventurous spirit and inquisitive mind. he introduced and ended each episode and i really enjoyed seeing him every week. i wish that walt disney's wonderful world of color was still on every week and that new episodes would still be made.", "this is a frantic disney animation which finally settles down to tell a touching tale. the animation is good and the story is quite dark. a less rushed first half would have made this much better.watchable", "23 july 2007. unfortunately this amazingly animated visual delight was spoiled in part by the excessive effort at trying too hard. the plot was very good, the emotional content was excellent along with the message of the story, the use of time travel was solid, but the execution in a number of spots, especially with the supposed villain was overdone and sometimes vapid and inconsistent with the overall tone of the movie. the use of animation for this particular project was apt and was spot on, the mix of realism and animation well balanced. if only the over-dramatization would have been reigned in this movie could have been another \"the incredibles\" that made a clear mark as a classic. unfortunately, this good movie just didn't have the consistency throughout to make the grade. seven out of ten stars.", "well, maybe the summary says it all. i don't understand why so many people seem to like this movie. the biggest problem for me is the story/screenplay itself and the characters. it all doesn't feel lived through. i just see a bunch of superficial, stereotypical characters, trying to overcome clichéd, uninspired obstacles. starting with a bad story, screenplay it's obvious that you can't have good characters/acting. if you want to see the exact opposite of this movie, go watch the iron giant, ratatouille, the incredibles, wall-e, ...the bowler hat guy is probably the most uncharismatic, uninspired, superficial character i've ever seen in an animation movie. the acting, the gags, it all feels really lame, probably because of the story. you can't have good acting, characters if the story's bad. it's something that i think works both ways. anton ego (ratatouille), now that's a well fleshed out characters. the way he moves, talks, looks, acts, it all feels right. just as the chef, skinner.", "it's been a while since i saw meet the robinsons and i was thinking of seeing it again for a long time, but i never had that chance, because there are so many films that i want to see and it's impossible for all of them at the same time. now after having the chance of watching it i can write my very short opinion about the film - what i like and what i didn't like. the animation is very hit and miss in some areas. the environments are detailed and look photo realistic and some character models look very good, but the movements can be sometime very weird. those types of movements can easily work in a traditional animation, but here it doesn't. the story is very good and it does have many good moments here and there, only the parts where they try to do some humor are the weakest. it doesn't try to make the time travel confusing or inconsistent and it's not the main focus on the story. it's used as a framework, so that the story can focus more into the characters and the adventure, just like other good movies involving time travel. the time travel is told very simplistically, but it works. the script / dialogue is in many occasions very bad and good. the problem is that the script is relying on the humor by telling jokes so much and of course most of them falls flat. there is good cinematography, but also very standard shots. the music by danny elfman is very weak. only three tracks i remember were great, but the others are forgettable. the direction is solid, but only the weakest parts are not. the sound is great - what else do you need to know about it. the acting, depends on the country you live in can be considered great, bland or bad. here it's great. in conclusion: the film is a enjoyable ride (with weak aspects), that can be appreciated and enjoyed by everyone. it may not be the best film by walt disney, but it's still can be considered good. for me it will always has a special place in my heart.", "somewhere walt disney must be smiling. \"meet the robinsons\" is the perfect, unlikely marriage of manic, absurd humor, eye-popping visuals and honest-to-goodness emotional depth. it is a close cousin to the first \"back to the future,\" yet it feels completely original at the same time. the 3-d animation works seamlessly within the story. it is not played for a cheesy gimmick (like, for example, \"spy kids 3-d\"...groan). in fact, it is so well integrated into the narrative that you could almost take it for granted, so it's a good thing that at the heart of \"meet the robinsons\" there is a wonderfully entertaining story. in typical disney fashion the central character is a motherless (and in this case, fatherless) youth -- however this time it is not merely a device whose sole purpose is to leave him unencumbered to embark on his own adventure. in fact, his orphaned status and quest to find the mother that left him at the orphanage as a baby is the point of his journey. but there's no room for sugary sap here, thanks to an almost unending stream of quirky characters and plot twists. of course stories like this can't succeed without a great villain. in this case the filmmakers have managed to craft a bumbling villain who is simultaneously hilarious, sympathetic and just menacing enough to keep the tension going. he reminded me of snidely whiplash, mack the knife, and the magician from rankin-bass' \"frosty the snowman,\" all rolled into one.this movie has all the seat-of-your-pants fun of a great amusement park ride and still manages to make you (well...me) cry at the end. the deft combination of love and laughs results in a movie that stays with you well after the lights have come up, leaving you wanting more. it is rare nowadays for and entire audience of moviegoers to spontaneously burst into applause at the end, but that's what occurred when the credits began to roll for this film. \"meet the robinsons\" is loaded with enough heart, rapid fire jokes and blink-and-you'll-miss-them sight gags to make it worth repeated viewings. we can't wait for the eventual dvd release -- hopefully in 3-d. come to think of it, we really can't wait, so we're going to see it again on the big screen.", "this is cute, and i'm glad i watched it.the beginning is just too chaotic and slapstick. it turns out that there is a reason for that, so you have to keep watching or you won't get it.you won't believe it, but it all eventually comes together to form a coherent and meaningful plot line. this is important to know going in, because otherwise you may stop paying attention or give up altogether. i almost did and now i am glad i didn't i gave this only seven stars based on the story telling. it may deserve more.", "the robinsons is a one weird family. it takes time to know them, and once you do, you will like them.they come from the future, filled with colourful buildings, flying jets, travelling tubes that would remind you of the jetsons. everyone is strange in their own way, from frannie who conducts frog band, grandpa who wears his clothes backward and twins dimitri and spike who stay in flower pots. plus a talking robot like c-3po.in back to the future style, 13th year old wilbur robinson brings a smart nerd lewis to 2037 to recover his invention. are you lost yet? now, all these eccentric characters and story can be quite hard to understand. everything happens so fast, so don't lose your attention.once you get past the initial stage, everything falls nicely into place like a jigsaw in this intricate story. although there isn't one main character who will appeal to you like the incredibles, the whole robinsons family will charm you the same.some critics may say: too many characters. too much dialogue. too confusing. too many things happening at the same time. indeed, there were points where young children may go \"huh?\". nevertheless, the singing frogs, big-headed dinosaur, colourful setting and music from danny elfman makes it all quite likable.with a strong \"keep moving forward\" educational message and a touching ending, this animation is recommended to families who will continue to enjoy this work from disney.(as a bonus, audience will also be brought back in time with a nostalgic cartoon featuring mickey, donald and goofy)", "a lovely disney movie about the importance of perseverance and family. lewis is an adorable little orphan who goes on an amazing adventure after his science fair project is sabotaged! the voice acting is great, the characters are wonderfully quirky, and the animation is out of this world. quite a cute, feel good movie.", "i wanted to like this movie. but it falls apart in the middle. the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely, but the middle runs off tangent. the people i watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course, and hoping it would end sooner than it did. another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment! i found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot. i bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well, but it lacks pixar's writing and soul. i think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule, while missing the plot. people old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily. edit out most of the middle section, make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid flick. i wish i had better things to say. but i don't", "outside of the beautiful faces that i helped to create and another that made an honest man of me...i truly loathe most everything that passes as...anything, truly. i took two of my sons and a young friend of theirs to see meet the robinsons, today. having never wanted to shout anything from a mountain top - let me just offer up a piece of advice for anyone looking for something uplifting, inspirational - heartbreaking but re-affirming...you must see this movie. i'm a braveheart guy, i love goodfellas and will ferrell movies - i'm an idiot; but i can't imagine hearing more beautiful words come out of my sons mouth than when we left the theatre and hearing him say \"that movie made me feel good about myself\". poetry - from the mouth and mind of someone who doesn't know any better - or any worse. the movie is about - and this isn't a spoiler - family and caring for someone other than yourself. it isn't standard disney stuff - even though that sounds exactly like standard disney. i'm running out space and i'm not completely making the most sense which is exactly how i feel at 37 anyway....do me a favor, do your drive to work tomorrow morning a favor...go see this movie. take an extra second in the morning to smell your kids, kiss your spouse and lay off your horn...it's nice every once in a while to leave something...inspired, and feeling \"really good about yourself\" - even for just a second.", "now for the truth, its very very weak storyline - for a walt disney film its total rubbish. when the robinson appear, the films all over the place, i was shocked how poor it was. it like \"alice in wonderland\" gone wrong!. it feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it - and they don't. after that, i sat there wishing for the end. my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story. the characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending, you just want the film to finish. its a film to forget, and forget quickly. if you've got some spare time, don't waste it on this.", "3/16/18. a decent animated disney movie that kids will probably enjoy. a good time-travel premise makes this a fun watch.", "every time i watch this movie, i get a weird existential dread after. i literally don't know why. reality just feels fake and dreamy. probably just a me thing. but this movie is great. i love the villain so much. the bowler hat guy is just comedic gold. i found lewis to be a great protagonist. his backstory and mindset is believable. i also love going to the future and meeting the quirky robinson's. i found them super weird and kinda useless, but fun nonetheless. the humor in this movie is surprisingly amazing. i found myself laughing a lot more than even the best disney movies. one thing i really don't like are those terrible songs that play at the end and beginning. i found them really bad and kinda triggered that existential crisis for some reason. but holy crap, this movie an underrated gem in disney's catalog.", "released back in 2007, meet the robinsons is a cg-animated science-fiction film about a young orphan inventor who travels to the future and meets the most eccentric family out there. while it did quite well with critics, this was a commercial disappointment for disney.having just acquired pixar and made john lasseter the animation department's chief creative officer, disney was keen to get out of its relative rut following the likes of flop home on the range and the mildly successful yet critically panned chicken little. unfortunately, meet the robinsons did little to improve things at the box-office and, despite the generally positive feedback, audiences didn't seem sold on a retro-styled sci-fi movie based on a lesser known children's book. or, perhaps it was the animation style that didn't instantly resonate. indeed, there's something about the look of early 3d animation that can be off-putting: characters look too plastic and smooth, they move like puppets, the camera angles are all over the place, the backgrounds lack texture and shadows.by the time bolt was released, a year later, disney seemed to have perfected its cg but meet the robinsons still very much felt like something closer to toy story 2, which came out a full 8 years earlier. based on that and the film's plot, audiences might have just expected another jimmy neutron: boy genius and decided to skip it altogether.meet the robinsons, however, is a much better film than you'd expect and those who missed it back then actually missed something worthwhile. beyond the familiar boy genius invents cool stuff scenario, there's a really clever time-travel story with a lot of heart and a surprising amount of depth. when young lewis, who spent all his life in an orphanage, is taken to the future by a school friend and discovers a utopia in which a family welcomes him with open arms, it's like a dream come true. things get complicated very soon, however, when a mysterious villain and his robotic bowler hat get in the way and the robinsons appear to reject lewis all of a sudden.you wouldn't expect this movie to deal with deeper themes like letting go of the past and isolation but it does and lewis' story packs an emotional punch that's well worth sticking around for, plus it's got some clever twists up its sleeve. the film is also proudly surreal and weird: the robinsons are all extremely wacky, you've got singing frogs, a brainwashed dinosaur, a bowler hat dystopia... this is a much more creative, funny and heartwarming animated feature than people give it credit for, that's for sure.although the cg isn't quite as good as it could have been and the animation style itself is a little bland, meet the robinsons is an underrated sci-fi adventure with some fun characters, a sad yet uplifting story, lots of amusingly goofy moments and it's altogether very enjoyable.quite good.", "one of the most underrated pixar joints out there. i'm late to the game watching this, i don't even remember it coming out, which must mean the marketing is to blame. whatever, moving on. the characters are based on a short story but the film is more or less an original futuristic animal. it is about a few orphans boys, time travel, an evil hat- android and an insane family. the magic behind the film is almost everything else about it except for the characters borrowed from the children's novel it is supposedly based on. the magic behind this film is that it is more or less a love letter to walt disney and the ideals he built his company on. to simplify it, this film is disney world's tomorrowland mixed with walt disney ideals. this film is an excellent hidden gem and i highly recommend it.", "was a little \"ify\" about taking my 5 and 2 year old daughter's to this movie. actually was concerned that it may not hold their attention. based on some reviews, i honestly didn't think i would care for it.being a huge fan of disney's work, but seeing their young target audience erode to the digital-only studios, i was hoping they'd come back to strong story lines.well, meet the robinsons was a surprise to me. had a great story line, extremely visually appealing, awesome voicing (i do professional voice work so have a different appreciation for this), and an all-round great movie.the only negative thing i must say (without spoiling the movie) is that when it came down to the part of the movie where it changes and you see much more of the hat in the future (again, don't worry.. no spoiler in this info) both of my daughters were pretty frightened and jumped to my lap. the visuals and content during this part of the movie really took on a different edge (color/music changes, etc.) as far as making it to frightening, i would hate in retrospect to see it changed to be a little more \"small kid friendly\". i would say that it might be a much better movie for children over 7 or 8 to see. i have to say again that as an adult, i thought it was really great.one of the features of this movie i thought was clearly outstanding was the musical composition (and songs) that danny elfman (nightmare, corpse bride, simpsons, and a million other compositions) did. one particular song is such an awesome, up-beat, fun song that i really hope disney puts a push behind it to give it radio airplay. (i'm also a former radio jock in dover, athens, akron, cleveland, denver, fort collins, and madrid-spain) certainly elfman has written some great and memorable music (\"what's this? - nightmare before christmas), but i'd have to say the music in robinsons is some of his finest.i'd sum this all up in saying that, like the disney tradition, this is story with great writing, great music, a lesson to be learned, and fun in general. it might be a little too much for the very little kids (even beauty & the beast or aladdin had parts that could be frightening to very little kids though). i get (and hope) that disney stays on the course they've moved with robinsons. it's nice to see disney getting back to their roots for story telling, yet moving forward (shrek-like) with their animation and modern feel.on a side-note: ironically, the new opening cartoon (mikey, donald & goofy build a boat cartoon) was made to feel very old by disney. audio was clearly intentionally \"warbled\" (for old-time 1920's/1930's affect). it was shot in 4x4 ration (not tv's 4x3 or cinemascope) and drawn images were full of dirt-type flaws (specs that were on their drawings and not on the lens of the camera or projector and they \"jumped\" throughout the short cartoon). very tradition cartoon which traces back to the walt disney roots. wondered if it hadn't been placed to really show the contrast of the original disney and the new disney.", "oh boy oh boy oh boy this movie was fast fast fast and never stopped and it was about the future and the present and the past and all the characters, of which there were a lot, talked really really fast and the action never stopped and the themes involved family and togetherness and belonging and never giving up and letting go and always moving forward forward forward and it was kind of all over the place all the time every where and things popped in and then out and there was a lot of zow and bammy and boing and zap and slapstick and dinosaurs and lots of musical montages to speed the time but hey that'll keep our attention in this fast-paced world even though a movie that goes so fast fast fast makes me bored bored bored.", "\"meet the robinsons\" is just superb in every way - plot, animation, characters, substance, and music. all put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by all ages. clever, clever humor and wit - many things that only adults may understand. loved the way the story progresses and how it ends.love the music. gorgeous \"little wonders\" by the fantastic rob thomas played at the end coordinated with the story ending - beautifully done. and the phenomenal jamie cullum doing 2 great songs for frankie the frog - 2 bouncy songs, done to perfection by a great artist. enjoyed rufus wainwright's songs - fit in well with the story. and, danny elfman's score is wonderful. so, i also highly recommend the soundtrack!!! i really do not have enough superlatives for this movie. it could be my favorite disney film, (and i've seen them all). i definitely plan on seeing it again in 3-d. but, even in 2-d, it is not to be missed!!", "i was surprised at how much i enjoyed meet the robinsons. for me this was a decade where animated films were very hit and miss, and while no masterpiece meet the robinsons had something that made it memorable and watchable. i do agree the pacing does get a little too hectic, and the villain was a little too stereotyped for my liking, while there are some parts where it wasn't as interesting. that said, visually and technically it is a marvel, with the character designs good and the colours and backgrounds even better. the soundtrack was a great touch too, and while not exactly original the story isn't too predictable, too derivative or too saccharine. instead it is fun, while the writing is funny and smart while surprisingly complex too. and the voice acting is top notch from all involved. overall, not an animated classic but nothing to bury either. 7/10 bethany cox", "the most important things about animated feature films are are they suitable for children,and are children entertained by them?meet the robinsons is no question suitable for children,and my children,as well as other children present in the theater today,were entertained by it.i suppose in that regard,the film does it's job with flying colors.i regret to say that from an adult standpoint,it comes up profoundly short of the mark.while the animation is above average,the story,at least in my opinion,is (for lack of a better term) boring.it has its slightly humorous moments where i would give a slight chuckle,but i am afraid that's about it.the only bright spot for me was the five minute cartoon that preceded the feature,a tradition that this 40 something movie goer is glad to see resurrected,if only briefly.my advice is to wait for this film to be released on dvd.rent it,perhaps even buy it for your kids.they will enjoy it.adults? meet the parents,meet the fokkers,meet the feebles,meet the press,meet anybody but the robinsons.", "the bad: plot holes! oh, wow, there are plot holes big enough to dive a time machine through. now i'm usually pretty forgiving of this, especially for plots centering around time travel, but when i notice the problems during my first viewing of a movie and they are bad enough to throw me out of the immersive experience, then those plot holes are serious indeed. i won't spoil the movie by giving details, but i will say that you will need to work hard at not thinking too deeply into how the whole time travel stuff works for this one. another problem is the second act of this film really drags. our hero spends an inordinate amount of time being introduced to the ridiculous family. and it feels like the writers were trying too hard to make the family eccentric and in the end they hit a weird and unlikeable note. finally, if you are looking for a disney musical – this isn't it. no one sings. of course, for some people, that's a good thing!the good:the theme of 'family' was good. the foreshadowing was excellent and made me want to re-watch this (you certainly won't catch every detail on the first run through). the villain(s) were creative and fun. the resolution felt satisfying. the art design was pretty good throughout the movie too – there were very distinct looks to the future, the 'bad future', and the tiny glimpse of the past. while not an exceptionally beautiful film, it doesn't have distractingly poor cgi either. the mom view:i liked this enough to buy it, although i wouldn't necessarily suggest that for most people. i think this would be good for about an 8 year old or so. there's a short potentially scary scene, but likely on the most sensitive kids would actually get scared. there's also nothing objectionable, but the themes and convoluted time travel might confuse a younger kid. having said that, a younger child might be more forgiving of the plot holes and enjoy the silly second act more. in my personal opinion, this would be a fun movie to talk about afterwards to see what your kids think of time travel (how it would work, what they'd do if they had a time machine, etc.). overall, i'd say this is fun and worth seeing more than once, but it won't ever turn into a classic.", "a heartwarming story with eye-popping 3d special effects. if you have the option of seeing this in 3d, you should opt for it. the story is strong, so you will enjoy it either way, but since 3d is a rare instance in this day & age, you should go that route. this movie has a stellar cast that may not be the big a-list names like the dreamworks movies, but they are very talented and well cast in their roles. i prefer the subtlety of casting for quality versus stunt casting, and this movie delivered. you can tell that john lasseter played an important role in this movie - \"cars\" delivered the message that the journey is more important than the destination and \"meet the robinsons\" delivers a message about not living in the past...keep moving forward. john lasseter should be commended for helping lift disney features back to their glory days. i will be the first to admit that they are not there yet, but with his help and movies that focus on the story & the characters like \"meet the robinsons\", we won't have long to wait...", "i was quite disappointed. maybe i should have watched it in 3d, but for me it was not technically better (or worth) than a pixar movie. but comparing to a pixar movie it was too much of a \"mish-mash\", which means the storyline was not strong and engaging, it left me at times quite bored. the family part was very confusing, you kind of didn't see the jokes in the characters and they were not really interesting or important. the villain was really boring. it was very simplistic and predictable and lacked the warmth and quality of a disney movie...maybe disney is \"moving forward\", but it did not reach the sophistication of pixar and left behind the humour and wisdom of older disney movies. i gave it 6 out of 10, because i am sure that smaller kids will enjoy it, and the main character and the \"little\" roommate, were very likable.the massage in the end is also ...hm...educational.", "while i love the big majority of hollywood's cgi movies i was extremely let down by disney's first effort: chicken little. but alas, it got worse. meet the robinsons is so childish and ridiculous, it made me cringe on way too many occasions. while being imaginative with regards to the family and their surroundings the film fails in so many other aspects that made it quite painful for me to watch: the bulk of the jokes are leveled at so young an audience, it is hard to not be bored or even annoyed if you're over an age of 15. as a film that relies so much on a breathless succession of funny ideas, it inevitably suffers if those jokes are completely inane most of the time. a big factor in any animated movie, the bad guy lacks any kind of menace as he is a complete moron. the fact that the quality of textures and animations is among the least sophisticated in recent years didn't help matters much either. i liked the ending and how all came together but it couldn't bring back the 90 minutes of wasted lifetime that came before.i admit it: i'm certainly spoiled by pixar and dreamworks animation. yet i warn you to watch this movie being an adult with even half a brain.", "this was a really good movie that i still enjoy watching today, as an adult. the plot is pretty juicy once all the pieces are put together towards the end.", "lewis is a 12-year-old orphan and an unrelenting inventor. after 124 failed adoption interviews, he decides to find his mother instead. there are no clues other than the one in his head. he decides to invent a machine to read memories and thereby find a memory of her face when he was a baby. at the school science fair, he encounters 13-year-old wilbur robinson who claims to be a time cop hunting the bowler hat guy. the bowler hat guy is after lewis' memory reading machine and wants to claim it as his own.there are some interesting ideas and a time-loopy story. the robinson family is a little too crazy which isn't always fun. there is sometimes an overloading of wacky when animated movies want to stamp the word fun on the screen. it doesn't help that the story requires a bit of effort to work out giving it a sense of chaos.part of the movie is to highlight walt disney's words \"keep moving forward.\" i'm sure it was in the original requirements of the movie. it's not a catchy phrase. it's funny that rob thomas' song \"little wonders\" starts with the words \"let it go\". somehow, disney eventually landed on a catchier phrase. also the confrontation with dor-15/doris ends too weakly. lewis could have done that anytime after finding out that cornelius robinson invented doris. the time-loop story is a little difficult which adds to the chaos of the movie. overall, i like the movie and its concepts.", "i really wanted to like this film, but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant. the new york times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers' cartoon ('hello my baby, hello my darlin', hello my ragtime gal...'). but i challenge anyone to watch the fox/blue sky animated feature robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - a young inventor growing up, and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.cityscape - extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments....robots... - the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look.all of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end, implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other, with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity).the filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own, and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we don't have the attention span for anything less.the villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated, and he's a pleasure to watch. much of the rest of the film seems thrown-together. some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid-90s.the film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short. by the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.", "what do you want from a movie? or better, of the various types of movies you encounter, what are the types of things that give your soul value that you recognize?i think the more time i spend with film the more i value things that can only be found in film, that are extreme in this quality and that touch reality with the most economical and effective shorthand. abstraction and the contrast between intense and subtle, indirect.disney isn't usually the place i go for these experiences, at least not recently. they used to be experts at manipulating the code, the abstractions that touch little triggers in our minds that spin stories. that means the storyteller doesn't have to weave much of the story directly, rather play the storytellying instrument in our minds as an organ would be played. she works the machine. animation (and porn) seems to be where these triggers are purest. romantic comedies which are a blend of the two.here's why i liked this and why i recommend it to you.the story is clumsy in the beginning. i think we can expect this. kids are patient for a while and there was a deliberate decision to set up some lengthy story lines at the beginning so that we can have an amazingly economical wrapup at the end. what we remember is the end of course, so this is a good tradeoff. and the story is corny as can be. that's what you get when you abstract into this space. audiences yearn for these stories and though i do not, they don't bother me. much. you can see the influence of lassiter (from pixar). supposedly the whole thing was redone after he saw the nearly finished project. in a way, its better storywise than what does from scratch. its darker. the evil here has a lower bottom than you'll find in pixar projects. their evil is a matter of music and escape. the evil here is palpable, a mix of human evil (eventually reversed) and some supernatural evil that is much deeper. it derives from and plays with noir.its all abstract. the core of the story is \"writing\" the future: \"moving forward,\" used as a catchphrase as well as a cinematic philosophy.so yes, even on the story end, i would be sending you to this. but mix that with the artwork....what i saw was the three d version. now you should know that once i traveled across the country (talking us here) to see the only copy, recently restored of the three d \"dial m for murder.\" that technology required two projectors, meticulously reconstructed and synchronized. and it required finding and restoring two independent copies of the film, one for the left eye and the other for the right. it was an amazing experience, seeing how hitchcock, who invented the curious camera, used on-screen space.so i'm a sucker for three d films, except for the so far silly things at imax. these guys got it right. its great, what they do. there's some self-aware stuff there just to show you they know you are there and aware of the effect. it increases the noir reality. but mostly, the three d is used subtly, in the service of the narrative. its rarely done, you know and i actually recognized some clear copies of effects from that old hitchcock film. see this, its very good.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 3: worth watching.", "this energetic but rather forgettable movie is nicely animated and has a fairly interesting story, but it's not especially funny. if you're expecting something as good as the incredibles or up then you won't get it.it strikes me as a good movie for kids. there's a lot of running around and a focus on the sort of antic humor that seems to appeal more to kids than adults. it's a very broad sort of humor. had i seen this movie when i was ten, i think i probably would have enjoyed it a great deal. but for an adult, i wouldn't say this is a great choice. although if you like broad, antic humor, perhaps age is not a consideration.", "lewis is an orphan boy that has natural affinity for inventions, but anyone goes well. one day, when he is going to present his newest invention to a \"science party\" a bowler hat guy and a mysterious kid from the future appear and the result is disastrous. the kid results to be wilbur robinson and came from the future, after some strange happenings, lewis travels to future and, then, he meets the weird family of the robinsons. first of all, the plot is the typical for kids: as simple as possible. but the simpleness ends there, most of the jokes and gags are quite absurd, much more than you'd expect in a disney's movie, most of the time things are happening too quickly to really realize what's happening and while presenting the robinson family, too much character appear at the same time. it's perfectly possible to lose the sense of the movie, and probably kids will understand less than half of the jokes, as many are absurd other they need some \"expirience\" to understand them. for an adult the movie is unexpectedly funny, like police squad or the recent scary movies, but it is from disney: humour is not so gross and there's no sex jokes. it is probable that the adult enjoy the movie more than his children, but although being quite stupid (the plot is just silly), i laughed a lot.", "for much of this film, even though i was being entertained by it, i thought it was geared mostly for kids.....and that's fine. that's what i always thought the target audience was in animated films. i just got spoiled with so many good ones in the last few years that also had a lot of funny material that adults enjoyed, too. films like \"cars,\" \"madagascar,\" \"barnyard.\" \"chicken little,\" \"the polar express,\" and so forth. well, in the end, i have nothing but praise for this film, too, because it had some touching qualities to it that would emotionally involve a person of any age. this simply turned out to be - at least for me as an adult - a really nice film with a heartfelt message of friendship, family and a sense of belonging. at the same time, it still had enough jokes, charm and colorful animation to make it interesting all the way.the film goes from so-so kid stuff to very good as soon as our hero \"lewis\" and his new friend \"wilbur\" go into the latter's world: the future. the most amusing segments of the film revolve around the robinson family, an eccentric but extremely loving group. that family makes this film tick and, hopefully, we'll see more of them in some future feature-length film. these guys - the robinsons - are just too entertaining to have their movie \"careers\" end with only this one film. the story brings out a very thought-provoking theme to ponder. how would you react if, as a 12-year-old boy, you could meet yourself as an adult perhaps 25 years later....and vice-versa? how incredibly strange that would be? or to see yourself face-to-face as a small baby?this movie really digs into deep territory in the last third, which is why, as an adult, i found it getting better and better right to the end.", "meet the robinsons, the latest offering from disney/pixar, proved to be very entertaining and humorous. the comedy is outrageous and very random, which is very much in line with the direction of modern comedy. there were plenty of times that i forgot that i was watching a disney film. older adults might not understand the randomness and craziness, but the younger generations will appreciate its departure from the traditional disney-style humor. some things will slip over the heads of children but will surprise some with adult themes. for example, one character is married to a puppet that he wears on his hand. so essentially the joke is that he is married to his hand. nice one disney. way to teach are kids about masturbation in such a keen way. anyways... visually, the film takes animation to the next level without sacrificing the feel that an animated film requires. these are still cartoons, and they should remain that way. i appreciate the departure from reality and exaggeration that cartoons offer. so far as the story is concerned, it suffers from the lack of character consistency. one character is an absolute dunce and pure evil. but on some occasions is intelligent and tender-hearted. this may seem to be a more complex character but once you see the film you will understand what i mean. i don't understand how disney could let this slip under the radar and use it as a twist to the story. i think it hurts the story and could quite possibly ruin the movie for some critical persons. despite the weaker story, i still went away feeling happy and creatively inspired. i saw blades of glory the day before and was, as expected, disappointed. if your choosing between these two, go see meet the robinsons.", "nostalgia may clouden my view a bit but i think meet the robinsons is one of the best disney films ever made. with amazing characters and a great heart, this film feels like it was made with love. i really recommend it.", "the latest movie from walt disney features endless amounts of energy and randomness. at least, that's the best way i can sum up meet the robinsons, a flick about a young orphan boy, lewis, who is an oddball until he is transported to the future by his future son. confusing, yet interesting. as i mentioned, meet the robinsons runs on a lot of sugar, so be prepared to get sudden rushes of energy from the complete goofy feeling that the movie gives out in large quantities.robinsons has the typical disney touch- lighthearted, hard-to-resist fun. even when something isn't necessarily funny (for example, the singing frogs), it doesn't make you hate the movie for the failed attempt at humor, unlike a certain other comedian whose movie opened on the same day as robinsons. it's hard to compare this movie to other disney flicks, mainly because (to the director's and writer's credit) it's very different. the energy of bowler hat guy (the main evil man) is unparalleled by any character on screen-- the way he hops around and the way he says his lines is genius and makes you that much more interested in the movie. basically, if robinsons was done by any other company than disney, it would probably come out as flat and monotonous.like so many movies before it, robinsons starts off interesting but drags during the ending. my advice is to take the ending as what it is and remember more about the fun and random times in the middle of the movie. i should end this review on the note that it is good to see a rated g movie be for people of all ages, which is exactly what meet the robinsons was.", "i took my 7-yr-old and his two friends today and we all had a terrible time. a complete waste of time for the animators, meet the robinsons was poorly conceived, unoriginal, anxiety-driven, misdirected, and completely age-inappropriate. a couple of weeks ago we went to see a wonderful program of pixar shorts which was original, witty, good-natured, and fun for everyone - the complete opposite of meet the robinsons. unfortunately for us all, the price of the great pixar films of the last decade is that we have to now sit through horrible, directionless, inappropriate garbage several times a year. i imagine the meet the robinsons \"happy meal\" is next. somebody please stop these people. save your time and money, and snuggle up with a good book with your child. you'll both be better off.", "i saw this movie a little over a week ago and i thought it was a pretty cute disney film about the future of tomorrow. meet the robbinsons is one of those animated films where it has humor for the adults and the kids that works well and really clicked, not to mention the animation looked fantastic. while it's still not the best animated film this year, i would agree that it's in the top and wouldn't be surprised if it does get an oscar nod for best animated film. it really was that good, i was kinda surprised by the average rating on imdb, i thought the users would get a kick out of this film, but you can't win them all.lewis is a young genius who has been adopted and cared for by a wonderful family, but he desperately wants to know who his real mother is and find out where she is, so he can find out if she really did want to give him up. but that is put on hold when he makes a brilliant invention, and someone is after it, but he is quickly saved by another boy, wilber, and he is taken to the future where his invention has been put to great use. but since wilber wasn't supposed to take lewis to the future, he lies to his family that lewis is a friend visiting, but lewis discovers how wonderful it is to be with this family and wishes to stay. but he may have certain problems when the bowler hat guy desperately wants to get his hands on his invention to get all the credit and money.meet the robbinsons is a definite recommendation that i'm sure you'll get a good kick out of. it has great humor, a fun story, and fantastic animation, it's a blast for the whole family, or even for an afternoon with the friends. 2007 over all has been a pretty good start for films, let's hope the great animated flicks keep coming! 8/10", "'meet the robinsons (2007)' is one of disney's earlier cgi efforts. it sees its young, orphan protagonist (who's played by two actors due to the voice-breaking peculiarities of puberty) thrust into a 'tomorrowland'-like, retro sci-fi future after a mysterious teenager turns up and warns him about an equally mysterious man who wears bowler hat. it deals with the expected themes of family and believing in yourself, with the oddball characters of the future serving as a reminder that everyone deserves to be loved no matter how quirky they are. the narrative doesn't quite make sense in a number of key places (the time-travel is what mucks things up), but that isn't a massive issue and it doesn't stop the piece from being relatively entertaining throughout. it has a decent sense of pacing and a few stand-out set-pieces, too. its lead is a little annoying, though, even if he's written to believably behave like what he is: a kid. overall, though the movie isn't massively exciting and, in general, feels rather 'standard', it's a decently enjoyable effort that features a few fun sequences and an occasionally interesting aesthetic. 6/10", "i saw meet the robinsons the day it came out. i was expecting a pretty cheesy (but cute) family film. what i saw was an hysterical amazing film that a 17 year old girl, like myself, could watch with her friends and not just her family. the bad guy, bowler hat guy, was so pathetic and incompetent. the hero, lewis, you've just got to feel bad for him. his sidekick, wilbur, was probably one of the coolest characters, because of how weird he was. hell, his entire family was weird. but that was what made it better. and goob. i cannot write this review without bringing up goob. he was just so cute! he was lewis' roommate, and he was like, i don't know how to describe him and still give him justice.i strongly recommend going to go see this movie, i don't care if you don't have small children with you, or if your a teenager with an attitude problem. you have got to see this movie. i guarantee that you will absolutely love it!", "meet the robinsons is an uneven but generally entertaining and pleasant children's movie with some wonderful cgi renderings.lewis robinson is an orphan that no one will adopt. he is also a science genius. on the cusp of his 13th birthday he builds a machine that will help read his mind back to the day his mother left him on his doorstep, so that he can see what she looked like, as it is the only memory he has of her. unfortunately at the science fair, two things happen - he is accosted by one wilbur, who claims to be a \"time cop\" tracking a villain who has come from the future - and a villain in an evil robot bowler hat. the bowler hat manages to botch his demonstration, making it look like his machine doesn't work, and once he's left, dejected, the villain steals the machine.wilbur, the time-cop, turns out not to be an actual cop but a boy from the future who takes lewis into his time machine, where they zoom ahead to the time wilbur came from. the world of the future is one of the glorious highlights of the film - a candy-colored wonderland. the pixar influence is evident - the film looks very much like it had been rendered by the same people that did the incredibles.once in the future lewis is introduced to wilbur's large and very eccentric family, the robinsons, and learns the importance of getting his machine back from the villain in the bowler hat, who has the only other time machine in existence.the film is very good for children. my three-year old sat still for virtually the whole movie, and the only part that was a little too scary for her was when a possible alternate future is shown where bowler hat guy has won (in a way) and humanity is enslaved.in general, the film is a little too disjointed and uneven to earn a top rating. much of the middle section consists mostly of shtick, and while funny, it doesn't move the plot forward. people seeking deeper meaning will be disappointed, and the material is not emotionally challenging in the way spirited away was. but the beautiful artwork and animation made up for most of the shortcomings. while not a disney or pixar classic, this is an entertaining 92 minutes.", "the first 35 minutes of meet the robinsons is an incomprehensible mishmash of manic activity. it makes for and odd dichotomy, as kids watching it are probably torn by confusion as to what is going on, and simultaneously entertained by the manic humor on the screen.its the story about an orphaned kid who attends a science fair to show off one of his many inventions and is accosted by another kid who reputedly comes from the future. thats about all i got out of the first few minutes as it--i kept looking over at my kids to see if they were as confused as me, but the non-stop action kept them glued to the screen. although ultimately this movie's plot makes sense, its probably too complicated for the younger set to \"get\", and it really made me think that the creators were a bunch of stoned kids putting the craziest crap on the screen that they could think of.all in all, mtr is highly imaginative, visually stunning, and the kid from the future is animated to make him look like a jim carrey clone, which i doubt was accidental, although jim wasn't credited as far as i could see.this film could probably do better with multiple viewings on dvd, but its worth seeing on the big screen because of the great visuals.", "trying to figure out when the last time a movie from disney proper charmed me like this, not sure. i love the hefalump movie and i'm a fan of treasure planet- though once martin short shows up i think it goes off the rails. hefalump aside (thats a tv movie on the big screen- so i'm dismissing for purposes of comparison on that technicality- though its easily one of my favorite disney films) i think this probably the one film from the mouse house i'm happiest with since lilo and stitch. is it the equal of lilo? no it doesn't have the \"this is my family, its broken but still good\" moment that makes me cry every time- nor, and most importantly it does not have the bra wearing caped crusader(though there are moments and lines...)what the film has, that most other disney films don't, and which is the reason that lilo, and treasure planet and the other really good films work, is the characters. lets face it this movie is about characters- and how they interact. the plot- the time travel to the future and stop the baddie plot, isn't all that great, but the pieces are- all of the jokes, and emotion and everything else comes out of the people in the film. yes they are people, even the frogs and the t-rex and the hat. they created personalities for everyone and everything in this film. thats why the film works. you're in a place with real people, there are no cookie cutter characters, there are different people, not ones a dog, and ones a chicken and ones a fish or a pig like in chicken little.(which has moments- and two or three real characters). no one is a stereotype or if they are they bend the rules- the bowler hat man is typical snidely whiplash characterization, but its turned on its head- things are not what you think they are with him. i loved that they dressed up what you expect with things you don't- the twist of who the robinsons are-what you can't guess?- twist rules that you would expect from old time travel movies to make a new sort of sense.frankly the plot is disposable- but the people are not.the lines of dialog are not. i would love to know what was cut out of this film-65% of it was apparently removed and re-shot-i'd love to know what was there(hello dvd)- what gems might it contain. i'm guessing the film was more rambling- probably like robots.i loved this movie, i've been thinking about it since i saw it, which is unheard of on a disney film-more importantly i'm not remembering the jokes, but the people and the sets and the gee whiz feeling i had. i really want to see it again.", "\"meet the robinsons\" is an animated children's movie that may be just a bit too complicated for its intended audience to follow. that's not really much of a surprise given that the scenario centers around a young orphan boy with a knack for inventions who spends most of the movie traveling back and forth in time between the future and the present in a tale so convoluted that even adults may have trouble fully comprehending all of it.for much of the duration, \"meet the robinsons\" feels frenetic and undisciplined, seemingly willing to throw just about everything but the kitchen sink into the mix in the hope that somehow it will all come together in the end. this explains why the movie features a family of eccentric nitwits (the robinsons), a rampaging tyrannosaurus rex brought back from the past, and a villain with a snidely whiplash moustache whose sidekick is a mechanical bowler hat that makes r2d2-type noises.yet, towards the end, the movie does, in fact, manage to bring most of these disparate elements together and to arrive finally at a satisfying conclusion. the backgrounds and animation are not quite up to the standards set by, say, \"ratatouille\" or \"wall-e,\" but the brightness of the colors, the quickness of the pacing and the enthusiasm of the vocal performances should keep the little ones intrigued for the duration - even if they don't always get what's going on in the story.", "for all those people who are like,\"i'm whining about this movie because it offended my made up adopted sister!\" (i'm looking at you consideratekid) i'm willing to bet that you

whining about it.", "this could have been so much better. it's a fantastic story idea but the screenplay wasn't done right. it floated off track a lot & lost its way. i see the potential for this to be way better than it is. i am sad because i love disney & don't know how they could blow it. it's like they weren't trying very hard. it's missing that shine that only disney's has. i can totally see how with a story like this & with disney's talent, money, & backing this could have been a spectacular movie. instead we have a mediocre so so ho-hum movie with a 6 rating.", "this animation movie deals about family.thus, it was a good choice for my \"family\".the story is a cousin of \"back to the future\" but lacks of its genius: no really fun and the vision of future isn't original. if animals are left in this feature for humans, the audience doesn't win because the characterization is very poor and unidimensional.even danny elfman seems asleep this time, and personally, i followed his attitude because i still haven't understand the final \"encounter\"! but my friends have appreciate it and that's the essential. and we left the theater, all agree \"to go forward, whatever happens!\"", "last year i saw some animated monstrosity at a drive-in theater. it was completely insipid, unfunny and dull. if anyone liked it had to be a kid and a kid who scarfs down paint chips. throw in the voice of ray ramano and you will know why i was cringing in the backseat until the the movie's complete awfulness compelled me to leave. the only other time i left a drive-in theater was when a tornado was in the area.meet the robinsons was the exact opposite of the above. it was funny. kids and adults can enjoy this story. it poses some interesting conflicts and doesn't skirt the consequences. letting go a lugubrious past for a brighter tomorrow is the best way to move forward. i'll be recommending this at work on monday.", "containing some elements you'll recognize from back to the future and the wizard of oz, meet the robinsons is a charming and amusing 3-d computer animated movie. a 12-year orphan has failed to get adopted more than 100 times because he keeps inventing things that always result in disaster. then one day, someone a year older from the future takes him on a journey there in a time machine as he meets the robinson family who provide him all the joy lacking in his present time. i'll stop right there and say while there is a rushed quality in the first 30 minutes, things slow down eventually to the point that you're left feeling inspired at the end. wish the movie could be funnier but i wasn't completely disappointed. by the way, there is a punchline involving a famous celebrity that pays off at the end that i don't want to spoil here. and it's preceded by working for peanuts, an amusing donald duck/chip 'n' dale cartoon that was also in 3-d when it first came out in 1953. what awesome visuals both films had!", "i kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace. but, i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north. it is definitely not montana north and never will be. americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason why. stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet. such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations. even in jest. i would never refer to the usa as 'alberta south'. walt would never put us down, so why start now. other than that the film was pretty goofy, better luck next time.", "in present day lewis (jordan fry and daniel hansen) is a 12 year old orphan boy who struggles to get adopted due to his eccentric personality that's heavily devoted to inventing. following the latest rejection from prospective parents, lewis devotes his time towards inventing a memory scanner for the school science fair with the intention of using it to remember his mom in the hopes he can reunite with her. at the science fair lewis is approached by an eccentric boy named wilbur (wesley singerman) who asked lewis if he's seen a suspicious man in a bowler hat (stephen anderson). unbeknownst to lewis, the bowler hat guy's hat is a sentient robot and sabotages lewis' project which frustrates lewis and causes him to abandon his pursuit of inventing. wilbur finds lewis and attempts to get lewis to continue inventing claiming the future is at stake but lewis doesn't believe him until wilbur takes lewis to the future which holds wonders that amaze lewis but the two crash when lewis attempts to use the machine to locate his mom and must go to wilbur's family home where they meet the robinsons while lewis and wilbur try to fix the time machine. meanwhile bowler hat guy and his sentient hat doris attempt to unmake the future by stealing lewis' memory scanner.meet the robinsons was the second 3d animated feature from walt disney animation studios following their 2005 film chicken little. the movie is an adaptation of the children's picture book, a day with wilbur robinson by william joyce who would go on to art design for a number of films including toy story, a bug's life and blue sky's robots and is credited as a writer and executive producer on the film. the crew was still very new to the media of 3-d animation and had the challenge of animated appealing human characters which the crew took inspiration from the likes of the incredibles and 1950s animated films such as alice in wonderland, cinderella, and warner bros. cartoons in their approach to the aesthetics. while intended to be released in 2006, the film was in production while disney was in the process of acquiring pixar and john lasseter would head up their animation division at disney and around 60% of the film was scrapped with changes made to the ending, villain, and other aspects to improve the film. upon release the film received mixed reviews from critics (though more positive skewing in comparison to chicken little) and was also a box office failure grossing about half of what chicken little made. there's a lot to admire with meet the robinsons, but there's also the expected growing pains of a studio still refining their approach and direction albeit more in regards to the story side of things than the animation itself.in terms of the animation meet the robinsons is a massive improvement from the sloppy aesthetics of chicken little with the texture work, character models, and animation much more smoothly rendered with things such as repeated character models no longer calling attention to themselves. the movie also ditches a lot of the mean spirited humor we saw in chicken little that was trying to ape dreamworks' styles and sensibilities and as a result meet the robinsons' identity feels like it fits more within the spiritual attitudes of a disney project. while william joyce's art designs do carry a slight sense of déjà vu in regards to his designs we saw in stuff like robots or a bug's life, there's enough distinction in the design work to help the film stand apart from those other projects with the future created by meet the robinsons quite wonderous as it looks like metropolis as filtered through the lens of dr. seuss and disneyland with a very utopian approach you'd see in some things such as isaac asimov's depictions of the future where futuristic architecture was integrated with natural formations with both in balance with each other.in terms of characters the robinsons themselves are an eclectic bunch of eccentric oddballs who run the gamut from space hero pizza delivery guys to frog conducting musical virtuosos and this does lead to some unique visuals and sight gags with the group as we get to know this world. the villain of bowler hat guy is wonderfully over the top as played by stephen anderson as he's designed with his black cloak, hateful sneer, and handlebar moustache he at first seems like the standard archetype a la dick dastardly or snidely whiplash but he's written in such a way where he wants to be that kind o stock villain but is really bad at it and the true brains of the plans is his mute but sentient and intelligent bowler hat. what doesn't work for me with the movie is our lead character lewis and frankly i think lewis is way too oblivious, selfish, and unlikable as a protagonist and the writers and lewis tend to use his status as an orphan to excuse a lot of selfish actions the character does. i know the writers try to say lewis is just sucked into his work to such a degree he loses track of his surroundings and anyone in his proximity, but the movie leads so heavily on that excuse as a crutch that it pretty much snaps and any time lewis gets angry or does something opportunistic or without regards to how it affects others it made me really dislike the character. i will say the ending montage is quite good and the quote they leave the audience did make me feel good to a degree, but i also had to endure lewis' selfishness and obliviousness so it was really a mixed bag of the good parts with the not so good parts.meet the robinsons has a solid message and an optimistic air to it that made me want to like this movie more than i actually did. the movie is a massive improvement from chicken little because unlike chicken little this movie at least has a soul and knows what it's doing and that makes all the difference in the world. i know some people who love this movie and i can certainly see why, but it's those little flaws that pile up that keep me from wholeheartedly recommending it. still it's got enough good points to give a marginal recommendation.", "the characters are great and so's the animation, with a story that is original and consistent. there are a few moments that annoy me but there aren't many and aren't for very long. the villain is very entertaining and has a personality that i would really like to see in more disney movies. the ending is also brilliant, and is something that i didn't see coming at all! it's not really one i would watch over and over, but it's still a great underrated movie that i'd recommend giving a watch!", "though \"meet the robinsons\" doesn't offer fantastic storytelling--it feels like an original feature from the cartoon network--it is a technical and design marvel. the storytelling is just good enough to keep all ages entertained, but the character design is quite good and the 3d presentation is a wonder to behold. the film is preceded by a classic disney cartoon that, while in 3d, looks very flat. the characters look like paper cutouts which actually diminishes enjoyment of the cartoon. the 3d flattens the on screen characters and makes them look more artificial.but when \"robinsons\" starts, you immediately note the contrast between classic 3d and the new disney technique. the film opens with a gee whizzy rainstorm that's very effective. rain falls in the foreground, while in the background a mother places her child on the steps of an orphanage. though the scene is a dramatic staple, the effective 3d technique breaths new life into this clichéd moment.what follows is pretty standard animated fare about time travel, following your dreams, finding a place in the world, etc. the film borrows pretty liberally--pays homage(?)--to many other films including a climactic chase with moments ripped directly from \"return of the jedi\" and \"the matrix\".but the character design is fantastic, filling the movie with interesting caricatures that are practically dickensian in their lovely grotesqueness. two favorites include the lanky arch villain and the hyper-jock gym coach. these characters are comic inspirations brought to life by the 3d effect. \"robinsons\" takes the gimmick of 3d and uses it to elevate a so-so film to a perfectly enjoyable one.", "keep moving forward, is the simple but powerful message of this witty and feel good movie. brilliant work on the animation and a strong soundtrack!", "i'm surprised that there were as many positive comments about this movie as there were...it seemed like the creators thought that the more characters they introduced, the better the movie would be. in reality, it just makes things more confusing, and none of these characters was compelling enough to make me care all that deeply about what happened to them.it's watchable, but it doesn't remotely compare to any of the pixar films in terms of great storytelling or humor.i am very glad that disney got things straightened out with pixar and is leaving computer animation to them.", "looking past the time travelling plot holes that every time travelling movie will obviously have, this movie is refreshing and unique in its own way. it's not trying to create the perfect well-rounded time travelling story but rather use these plot devices and themes to tell a well-known story in an unconventional way. while at first you might imagine and predict where the story is going and even the ending of it, what makes the movie stand out and shine is its journey to that conclusion and the quirky characters you find along it.while its early computer animation at first would not reminisce that of disney's actual that we are accustomed to due to its outdated graphics but mostly due to its style, specially with the movements and expressions of the characters (which reminds more of sony animation's hotel transylvania); the character and world designs are refreshing and colorful as it draws inspiration from the very imaginative retrofuturistic vision of the 50s and 60s like previous animated shows like the jetsons have done.a style that lends to many interesting character and world designs that don't hold back in wackiness, colorfulness and absurdity (portals that lead to toilets, twins that live in pots...). but it's the mix of the witty and quirky line deliveries, dialog and character behavior randomness that makes you want to hear and see more of these characters as well as learn more about this amazing future.some have criticise its deep and heartfelt story referring to it as \"too dark\" as it tackles childhood abandonment and childhood trauma (fueled through the main villain). while some would find this plot too deep for a kid to understand, i'd argue the more darker nuances of the story would be picked up by the adults alone while the kids would be distracted with the visual story that is being told. i only see this movie as a daring and unconventional vessel for experiencing a story with themes we have heard of before but focusing more in the moral and ethic behind it. where some would tackle and learn the pessimistic attitude towards these very sensible problems, this movie tries an optimistic approach of redemption and learning from our mistakes and to never give up. \"keep moving forward\" as the movie's quote so positively puts it.in conclusion, this movie is well-rounded in its message and moral, and it's a very witty and funny adventure fueled by imagination and the modern vision of the future of the 50s and 60s. it's wacky, quirky, random and odd in a charmful way and if you can see past the outdated first steps of computer animation, you will be treated to an endearing story of finding your family and to never give up.", "amiable sequence of visual gags that should have just been a saturday cartoons.the heavy handed message about making the most of your life weighs it down and makes disney's first cgi affair without pixar a bit of a misfire.as sickly as it can be overall, there are a lot of cool moments: \"i question how well this plan was though through...\"xd", "disney should be leading the pack. with this movie they have put both resource and effort into regaining the acclaim they've lost in recent times. in the uk an old mickey mouse short was included before the main feature, which highlighted how much more dynamism and vivid imagery is available to creative animators these days. on the other hand it also proved that charm, imagination and storytelling can not be computer processed quite so easily.my seven-year-old daughter thought the film was \"great\" and wants to see it again. this makes a great deal of sense to me; this film has so much going on that repeat viewing, especially on dvd, would be rewarding for younger children. my 12 year old son view was that it was \"ok\"; my interpretation being that the plot was lashed together with little thought for pace and coherence in the hope that the colourful graphics and snappy (but unfunny) dialogue would cover up the plot holes. he was not captured by the disney magic.disney needs to re-find the humour and storytelling that used to be their forte. take a few more risks and use all that new animation technology to be more innovative, they could then be back on top of the game.", "i watched this movie just by chance, and was really surprised about how much i enjoyed it. with a good plot twist and amazing animation, meet the robinsons is great fun for any age and is one of the few disney films that isn't complete and utter rubbish nowadays.i am a huge fan of the disney animation movies and i was really pleased to finally see a film that isn't complete trash from their camp. recently nearly everything they release seems to be unrealistic, weak and pathetic; they're churning out stupid films, awful compared to their beautiful era of older renaissance movies, the much loved classics loved by all. meet the robinsons is the best production i've seen disney let out since tarzan (1999), and i'm glad to say that.the animation is stunning - complete 3-d brilliance. the characters are also extremely well developed with much more depth than one

say i normally never would have seen this movie, but i ended up going for a computer animation class i am taking. i have seen every pixar film in theaters, but every other disney 3d movie i have seen were disastrous.although i didn't love the movie, it didn't didn't leave me with the distinct aftertaste of garbage that i have come to expect from non-pixar disney 3d movies. it wasn't all great, though. the majority of the first half of the movie was extremely slow, and most of the jokes fell flat. it is the later half of the movie that made the film. the action was intense, and the plot twists were sudden and surprising. it felt very... satisfying. not something i have experienced in disney's previous attempts at cg animation. i give the film 6/10.the voice acting was very good for the most part, and the children they had playing the kid characters seemed to do alright. normally i would prefer a professional female v.o. to do the kids voices (nancy cartwright, tress macneill)

better than those cyan/red glasses, or even imax 3d. it was all very clear, with none of the \"ghost effect\" that you get with other methods. the 3d wasn't the focus of the film, which was refreshing. it wasn't too distracting, but it gave a sense of depth and reality that normally isn't possible viewing it in the traditional way. i give the 3d aspect 9/10.all in all i enjoyed this film, but issues with the pacing kept it from being excellent. overall 7/10", "meet the robinsons is an animated gem that often flies under the radar, yet it delivers a powerful message about resilience, family, and the importance of \"keeping moving forward.\" the story follows young lewis, a gifted inventor who is transported to the future, where he discovers a vibrant, quirky family and learns some hard hitting truths about his own life.one of the most inspiring elements of meet the robinsons is the soundtrack, especially \"little wonders\" by rob thomas. the song plays at a pivotal moment, encapsulating the emotional depth of the movie and driving home its message about embracing life's ups and downs. it's a track that sticks with you, offering motivation and a reminder of how precious even small moments can be.though the film may not have received as much attention as other animated classics, meet the robinsons is a heartfelt and uplifting story that deserves to be celebrated for its meaningful themes and inspiring soundtrack. it's a movie that leaves you smiling, motivated, and perhaps even with a few tears.", "lewis is a young and intelligent kid living in an orphanage. as he isn't easily adoptable, judging by the times he has attempted to and failed, he decides to invent a machine which could read minds in order to locate his mother. but, as he's about to present it at a local science fair, a boy from the future appears out of a sudden and informs him about a bowler hat guy who is presumably after his invention. from there, a couple of events and time travels will soon have a big impact on the little inventor, shaping him as the one he'll once become.it's an animation which comes with a very attractive idea, that of time travel. it presents young lewis as a clumsy young inventor who is full of life and determined to get himself a new family, even if that means to search for his origins. his inventions will one way or another push him to rethink his persona, regain confidence in his abilities but also introduce him to a future self who is quite different than he could have ever imagined. the movie's plot is interesting through its idea but unfortunately not very well implemented. it lacks complexity, being quite linear an predictable, despite the much different first impression it left. its characters are also quite simplistic, many of them having no implication in the story while others were lacking some features which might have made them good. simply speaking, they are not very likable. thus, it's hard to put yourself in their situation and empathize with them. they even try hard to be funny but unfortunately fail with every single attempt, not even a single laugh being produced along the way.the action is simplistic, bringing something new from time to time but nothing that can make a difference. you get two or three key points in the story which actually matter but the rest seems quite like a filler. furthermore, most of the character's actions seem to be quite useless or end us solving the problems way too easily, raising questions about the rest of the events which preceded that one that now simply make no sense. the dialog is also simple but it mostly does its job; no plus and no minus here. you're left with the impression that they had an idea but somehow decided to go on a different path, ending up in a completely different area than they should've.in terms of visuals, the movie doesn't impress either. it looks good, colorful and overall pleasant, but the animations feel a bit rough, while the voice acting seems a bit off from time to time. it's ok in this department but again, nothing impressive.it's an animation which left me quite disappointed. it had a great idea but managed to not take advantage of it, and i think the final result speaks for itself. instead of focusing on it, they've gone on a different direction, presenting some events which actually don't make any difference, or simply put, don't matter (not to say that they are also not interesting). put into equation a lame antagonist which is easily forgettable and you get a mediocre plot which doesn't do any good to the movie. they clearly should have invested more in this department but also in terms of character development and voice acting. it's a shame to waste something as catchy as time travel with such a boring plot.", "i remember watching this movie as a kid and enjoying it. the theme is simple yet powerful, \"keep moving forward\". it's definitely a step up from chicken little. lucas is an aspiring inventor who struggles to keep his gadgets functioning. as if that's not frustrating enough, he has to deal with the fact that he's an orphan who doesn't know who his mom is. things get stranger when a boy claiming he's from the future appears and starts following him. before he knows it, he finds himself in the future. where it seems anything is possible.the animation's cool. it's elastic and fast paced which works in its favor. the characters are nice and stand out. lucas' the wide-eyed, curious inventor trying to find his place in the world. the other characters are wacky and provide

held up. i feel like it's paw patrol quality not big screen quality.for the most part the acting is pretty good. i would say whoever plays the main character is a bit weak but it doesn't bring down the movie. the supporting characters and the action help prop this one up.the premise is different and the execution is well done with lots of humor sprinkled in for effect.i don't think i would rewatch this again on my own but if you have kids it's a tolerable enough movie to rewatch. i don't know if adults would care for it especially considering there's so many better things to watch.", "this is the best blockbuster i've ever laid my eyes on when i was a kid. i loved all of the funny moments, and to be honest, sometimes i feel like uncle joe has autism since he had a childlike nature, sucking his thumb, not talking much, etc. i thought it was cute and i still do. anyways the old-school animation is definitely spot on with this movie! they need a sequel too. you should watch!", "pixar, headed by john lasseter, has slowly been reviving walt disney feature animation back to its quality days of the early 90s, when beauty and the beast, aladdin, lion king, and others rocked the box office and captured the hearts of audiences everywhere. one of the first collaborations of disney animation receiving the pixar touch is meet the robinsons. of course, while pixar's films are far superior, meet the robinsons is a very hyper, friendly, and eccentric film that will entertain the family without ever being offensive. while the pacing and plot twists might be a bit much for younger kids to swallow, the message and humor make up for it.the film follows 12-year-old orphan lewis desperately trying to find a family to fulfill his desire for a family that would care about him. at the same time however, he scares off potential parents with his plethora of ideas and inventions. one of his inventions however begins to draw people from the future, leading to a crazy ride of a story that takes you through different timelines and dozens of unique encounters with a family from the future that despite the craziness seems to enjoy lewis' company. this movie awkwardly (and to an extent successfully) combines very fast-paced humor with deep story lines and a massive assortment of characters that will leave you entertained but then forgetful as to whom is named whom. that's what happens when you have half a dozen writers working on the screenplay.the writing in meet the robinsons is its main strength and its main weakness. its fast-paced humor (that sometimes occurs out of nowhere---try to explain the martial arts sequence at the dinner table please) hits more than misses, and really keeps the movie fresh and engaging. yet, there is very little character development, resulting in the main hero and main villain as the only dimensional characters in the movie. the rest of the cast is just like the humor; hit and miss. the frogs were rather annoying and unfunny, but the uncles in front of the door were hilarious and much underused.animation is a strong point in the movie, despite not matching to pixar standards. the art style of the future has a retro feel; exactly like tomorrowland in disneyland and disney world (we can even see space mountain for a brief moment). the rest of the movie is quite colorful and animated with plenty of energy and pizazz. unfortunately though, we didn't see enough of the future, as the focus is purely on the family and its antics. one would have hoped to see more of walt disney's 50s and 60s visions of the community of tomorrow that he expressed so dearly in disneyland and eventually in epcot.one of the most interesting aspects of meet the robinsons is its uncanny amount of plot twists and sudden revelations; especially towards the third act. while some of it can be predicted (the more movies you see, the quicker you can catch details) the usual audience will be quite thrilled at the inability to predict how the bumpy ride of a movie is going to end. but one can't help but feel sorry for the kids—who would be utterly lost in the third act by the time changes that run rampant. then the fast pacing doesn't help the kids at all. at least they have some wonderful music to listen to while being lost, courtesy of danny elfman.bottom line: meet the robinsons is one of the deeper rated-g films seen in recent times. basically meet the robinsons is the inferior yet happier version of wall-e; it's a children's film with deep adult values and a detailed vision of the future. the difference is, wall-e's future looks very depressing, and we didn't see enough of robinson's future. the zany humor is what keeps the movie afloat and the kids awake, while throwbacks to retro-future imagination and an engaging plot covering decades and different timelines will be sure to keep the parents and adults in check. after a slew of disappointing projects (dinosaur, atlantis, especially chicken little) pixar has breathed new life into disney animation. maybe in the future we will see a new disney renaissance. in the meantime, disney \"moves forward\" with a delightful family film that isn't spectacular, but will not disappoint either.", "i brought this movie on rent and thank god, i did so. spending more than hundred rupees isn't worth it for this crazy movie. the characters of this movie, except for the main one, look crazy and act in a crazy way that isn't funny. i have to admit that the voicing of the characters is done pretty well but the way the characters behave and what they talk makes me wonder what on earth is going on? suddenly some of the characters start shouting and do funny actions. the plot is pretty stupid and the story goes uninteresting till the end. i think this movie is meant for children ten and under. there are no, and i mean it, no jokes in the movie. animation too looked the same. the characters looked as if they were lifted from incredibles. disney should start making different kind of animation. towards the end, there was some of the disney touch, but that couldn't fulfill the stupidity they had done in the beginning. its worth a go once for hysterical disney fans and toddlers. but it is not so entertaining for teens like us who expect more from disney movies.", "a young boy inventor (whose inventions always seem to work on paper but

pioneers have passed this way, and just embraces all of the bizarre paradoxes inherent for comical effect. how would some of things that happen ever have happened if the time traveler changed history? this film answers, \"does it matter?\" and then just has some goofy fun with it. the \"twists\" involving the future characters vs. their past-tense couunterparts, in some cases are obvious for adults, but then, adults were not the target audience. kids will accept what the film says, and that's the key to enjoying this film. trying to dissect it will ruin the fun.characters are well defined and likable, even the \"bad guys.\" back stories are developed well, and the story is overall written well. although you may predict some of the outcome, there are some surprises in how things end up, too. recommended family viewing.", "i really enjoyed this movie. it's just unfortunate that it's not widely talked about as other disney movies. it's a heartwarming story and has a theme song that has a brilliant message (little wonders). i absolutely love it.", "meet the robinsons is an animated film directed by stephen j. anderson, that explores the meaning of family through a time-traveling journey. the film features a blend of humor, emotion, and storytelling, with the futuristic robinson family adding a charming touch. the film delivers a meaningful message through witty dialogue and visually inventive sequences, showcasing a futuristic world filled with quirky inventions and endearing characters. it explores resilience, family bonds, and the importance of embracing failure as a stepping stone to success, making it a standout in the animated genre. the film is sure to leave a lasting impression on audiences of all ages.", "seriously understated movie. sure it's meant for kids but it's a fun and lovable story that all ages can appreciate.", "i'd like to hear what robert mckee and all the other scriptwriting gurus have to say about meet the robinsons. all the plot points, inciting incidents, sword-and-shield moments are in place, the characters have clearly defined motives that change and mature as the story progresses, the plot and sub-plots all resolve themselves neatly at the end, and the big themes - family, belonging, redemption - appear and tug away at the heartstrings. so why does it all seem too pat and kind of flat? has this structure finally worn itself out? the search for family, the need to let go, themes that worked so well in finding nemo, just don't get off the ground here. why is nemo full of magic and mtr formulaic? aside from that, the dialogue is way too fast-paced for kids, and most adults, too. who exactly were all those extended family members? in short, too pat, too contrived (even for animation) and completely lacking in originality.", "i've seen this movie 2x now, my child is grown, so i watched it for my own enjoyment, and that should tell you something! this is a fun family movie, but it also has a deep, involved storyline following the main character, a young man that approaches him at the science fair and turns out to be from the future, and a second player in the game, a man with an almost sentient bowler hat who also shows up at the science fair and sabotages our hero's project! we are also following that our hero is an orphan, and that plays a large role in the film. so, whether you're a child just looking for a cartoon from disney with a lot of laughs prat falls, or you're an adult looking for something with a little deeper storyline to entertain yourself too, this movie is a great choice! they did a great job all around!", "i wasn't expecting much out of this film. i do enjoy family movies, but the commercials for this flick never made me want to run out to see it. i did wind up taking the kids to it this weekend, but mostly because there wasn't really any other kid friendly movies out there at the moment.the movie was a lot more heartfelt, and touching then any advertisements would have you believe.the robinsons are almost a futuristic adams family, in that they are odd, and offbeat enough to make them interesting, yet loving and loyal enough to make them enduring.like most major films today (especially kid's flicks) the ending is a happy, feel good one (at least i think so) but any other ending for a movie such as this would just feel wrong. i think walt disney would be proud of this movie. after seeing it you'll might just quote \"always move forward!\"", "an orphan who is met by a boy from the future who came to warn him about a fiend who attempts to steal the orphan's invention that would make a difference in the world.the problem i had with this movie is that it seemed like the writers weren't trying enough when creating the story. good visuals, except story needs to be as even as the visuals. i know this was a kids movie, except i think kids deserve better movies than this one.the good thing about it, it was the first disney animation film to have the disney animation logo which was added in 2007 to separate it's films from pixar's.the bad thing about it, the characters that were cool hardly had any screen time compared to the characters that were lame and uninteresting. plus the bowler hat guy was just a stereotype villain that's already been accomplished decades ago. and we live in an era where villains can be evil without a mustache or black clothes.in conclusion it's something that kids can enjoy. but it's also something adults will turn their noses away from. if the disney company intends to make more animated movies, then they need to do a better job than this one. cause this looks like a b-movie compared to pixar's films.it would of done better if it was done by pixar.", "before i saw this, i didn't know anything about it. but as i watched it i got the plot. this movie is about an 12-year old orphan called lewis. he is a brilliant inventor, who meets a stranger called wilbur robinson. at the science fair, the bowler hat guy ruins his invention. so wilbur takes him to the future and together they must find the bowler hat guy.although, the trailer made it look like you see a lot of the family but you don't see them a lot. you mainly see wilbur. you do get introduced to the family but it doesn't happen until about the 30-minute mark.this movie has a good twist. although it's a tad predictable, it still works out. some of the humour was actually more for adults. as in when the bowler hat guy wrote find the $#%*&#$ boy, which obviously means the f word. then again, some jokes were for little kids as in the dinosaur saying that he has small arms and a big head. you probably saw that part in the trailer. the animation in this film was decent.this is much better than most recent animated films released in the past year, except for cars (which was good.) this is one of those movies that's not great but you just sit back and enjoy the ride. it's good to see that disney has taken a break from pixar. 3/5.", "this movie is about two boys, one from the past and one from the future. they went through time traveling to meet people and to correct mistakes. the motto \"keep moving forward\" means that you can't change the past, but you can change the future.", "i have seen almost all dysney movies, and this is one of the few that did'n touched my soul; it is pretty sad to come out of the theater after watching a disney movie in which you don't feel something truly special inside you; i felt something, but it wasn't something, as i usually do. this movie resembles a futurist view of the earth (year 3037) much like the jetsons; flying cars, round homes among other things, a little unoriginal, but i liked it. this movie also, is confusing for children; it has a lot of adult jokes, too much information, too much characters and dialogs that will confuse child; they will surely come out of the theater loving the personages and will want to buy an hamburger with a happy meal of them in that moment; but the movie won't stay at their hearts, like a lot of animated movies i saw as a kid (bambi, snowhite), or a little bigger (the lion king); the toys from the happy meal will get broken or to the trash very quickly. a really good message is left trough the movie, useful to kids and adults; that i loved! (and put a little higher my rating that was almost all the movie in 6) about the movie: meet the robinsons is the story of lewis an orphan boy that loves science and inventions; at the age of 12 he, still unadopted, participates on a science fair with an ambitious project, deeply moved by his desire of meeting his birth mother. during the fair, lewis meet wilbur, a boy of his age that came from the future and needs to track, find and stop bowler hat guy, a guy who stole a time machine from the future and have evil plans for this time. wilbur takes lewis to the future in a time machine where he finds his lovely and particular family (the robisons) in the year 2037, and join to wilbur's mission.the graphics and technological deployment of the film is awesome, by far the best that i have seen (in some scenes, like the crash of the spatial ship, you can see textures amazingly close to reality), i cant' imagine the rendering process that this movie had. 7/10!", "disney+ recommended this to me, and for some undefendable reason i've never seen it. it was a great surprise. a lot of laughs, heart, a nice and cool story and good visuals. a really good time, and i hereby declare this movie underrated.", "this movie is nerdy and rad. definitely stands up from many animation movies. the story is creative and colorful. there is a great deal of imagination. if you wanna watch an animation movie for all ages, that's a bit different, watch this.", "not a bad non-pixar attempt by disney. but they should have a rule that the director can't do voices for their animated films- the director does 3 voices for this film, and they all suck. i've heard mc'donald's drive through cashiers with better voices. disney-please stop letting the directors do voices past test animation! adam west does a voice and it shows how crappy the other voices are by contrast. its like the turtle in finding nemo its like vanilla ice cream swimming in a sea of more eccentric flavors- does this seem long winded after i've made my point? well imdb wants you to write at least 10 lines, is this 10 lines yet? i think i made my point can i post my comment now please?", "caveat emptor: we had already bought our popcorn and were finding our seats before we found out the movie was not being shown in 3-d. i don't blame disney for that, okay, yes i do, and the theater (oak grove 8, milwaukie, or) that sold us tickets without any notice that it wouldn't be in 3d. imagine paying to see \"honey i shrunk the audience\" and finding out it was 2d.that being said, once i caught on to the relationship of the characters, past/future, i decided i liked this movie's message, which is really less about \"moving forward\" and more about the responsibilities of friendship and the butterfly affects of our actions or inactions. the plot is clever enough and i suppose i'd give it a 7+ if i'd seen it the way it was intended. will the dvd come with 3d glasses? what'll that be, $5 extra?", "there's great potential there with the concept, but 'meet the robinsons' feels convoluted and rushed.the first hour of this is boring, once the (admittedly good) turn comes it does slightly improve. if you take out the main parts of this, you'll hold some good stuff - the message, the twist, the means are just some of them. sadly, everything that surrounds the positive things set it back.the cast aren't great either. it's cool to see a disney film, especially from this era and before, give new voices a chance; rather than giving roles to the usual suspects. unfortunately, none of this cast are memorable - at least to me. matthew josten has one or two funny bits as goob, they could've done more with him.animation-wise it's largely fine, though a few moments haven't aged incredibly. the end song from rob thomas is nice. all in all, however, this isn't a film i can honestly say i enjoyed. i wouldn't be opposed to a remake, if they ironed the execution out.", "in recent years, i've come to the conclusion that, as far as american studios are concerned, pixar is the only one producing great cgi-animated films. however, its always a delight to be proved wrong, and i am surprised to find that 'meet the robinsons (2007)' is a truly terrific science-fiction children's film, one that exceeded all my expectations. produced by walt disney animation studios, with john lasseter as one of the executive producers {so it's not so far from pixar, after all!}, the film is my most unexpected favourite of 2007, boasting a fresh and intelligent screenplay, as well as impressive 3d visuals. though the film deals with time travel, a rather sophisticated concept in itself, director stephen j. anderson ensures that the plot is straightforward to follow, approaching the notion of paradoxes in a manner than is easy for children to understand without being exasperating for adults. in addition to a terrific script {which is credited to about seven screenwriters}, 'meet the robinsons' also has a motivational maxim from which we can all take something: \"keep moving forward!\"young lewis (voiced by both daniel hansen and jordan fry), a twelve-year-old living at an orphanage, desires nothing more than to find a family who loves him. though he is undoubtedly brilliant, lewis' elaborate inventions have the peculiar habit of blowing up, and these unfortunate mishaps have thwarted his repeated attempts at charming any potential adoptive parents. while he works on a new invention, a device that will allow him to track down his natural mother, lewis is confronted by a mysterious young stranger from the future, wilbur robinson (wesley singerman), who warns that a sinister \"bowler hat guy\" (stephen j. anderson) has stolen a time-travel machine and is attempting to destroy lewis' future. whisking him off in a time-travel machine of his own, wilbur brings lewis to the year 2037, occupied by the most ridiculous family of eccentrics that you're ever likely to see. nevertheless, this unconventional gathering of quirky relatives represents the close-knit household for which lewis yearns, and his experiences with the robinsons inspire him to make the most of his future.perhaps it's my love for any film dealing with time-travel, but i genuinely found 'meet the robinsons' to be exceedingly charming, exciting and, above all, stupendously entertaining. though a few moments toe the line of respectability {i didn't care for the dinner food-fight that transformed into an epic anime battle, complete with shoddy dialogue dubbing}, the film carries enough emotional heart to leave you thoroughly satisfied by the time the end credits begin to roll. in addition to a twisting, time-bending plot, you'll also be able to witness an ensemble of jazz-singing mafia frogs {an amusing nod to chuck jones' 'one froggy evening (1955)}, an unbelievably dim-witted antagonist, and a dystopian version of the future ruled by malevolent mechanical hats {i actually found this segment to be rather disconcerting}. most memorable of all is the robinson family's reaction to lewis' latest inventing failure, when his peanut butter and jelly dispenser spews its ingredients all over the dinner table. rather than the cold reception that i had expected, the entire household bursts into enthusiastic applause, his attempt alone being more than worthy of their encouragement.", "it's best if you try to see this movie in some sort of high resolution (like on a movie screen or in hi-def). the visuals are pretty amazing to watch. the action and zany dialog is almost non-stop. if you're a young kid, it doesn't get much better. if you're an adult, you'll have to give the first hour of the story some major slack (just enjoy the visuals and action and put your brain on hold); it gets better.the movie is about a genius inventor kid who yearns for his true mother since no one seems interested in adopting him. it seems he will become an important person because an evil time traveler is out to get him! fortunately, a time-traveler kid gets him first and brings him to the future, where he meets the rest of the family: the robinsons. the lunacy begins there as the inventor kid searches for a way to get back home.as insane as the first hour of this movie is, it does get a bit more mentally manageable when you learn more things about what's going on. even the lunatic characters (which is just about everyone in this movie) begin to act normally after the first hour.although this movie is clearly aimed at children, it can be fun to watch for adults who enjoy imaginative visuals. as mentioned earlier, you'll get the most from this movie if you can see it in some sort of high-resolution.", "disney animation has had some trouble getting its feet on the ground without the word pixar next to it and \"meet the robinsons\" is the kind of animated film more content with shaking things up. while the film has some lovable elements and does come together toward the end, it mostly suffers from jumpy, unsupported storytelling that will most likely have children thinking \"whoa?\" instead of \"wow.\"in \"meet the robinsons,\" lewis is a 12-year-old boy who was abandoned as an infant on the steps of an orphanage. because of his knack for invention-making, lewis can never find a family to adopt him, but all that changes when a stranger named wilbur robinson comes to him from the future, trying to protect him from a man in a bowler hat, and sweeps him off to the year 2037 where he meets the rest of the robinson family, a barrage of strange and eccentric characters.when lewis meets the robinsons, the film gets a little crazy. the pacing is so fast and the objective of the film becomes unclear. while the writers use this lightspeed pace to throw in some humor that you have to listen very closely to catch, little gets truly established and you don't feel like you really get to...meet the robinsons. disney's decision to break the number one formula rule with animated features: getting a slew of well known voice talent, doesn't help. as much as getting big names to voice characters is a selling factor for a film, sometimes it helps hasten the process of connection audience to characters. either way, no big names seems odd. we also know very little about the film's villain, the man in the bowler hat, and while his quirky nature has an appeal, his motives, for the first major part of the film at least, are unknown. classic villains have strong sinister motives in disney films, then their quirks come in, but \"robinsons\" works the opposite way.that said, somehow this film manages to pull it all together in revealing some important details about the future that show it's not merely coincidence that lewis is being helped by the robinsons. the strongest part of the film is its creation of sympathy for lewis, who desires parents and a family above all else, despite his incredible talents. as the film ends and these details are revealed and lewis' fortunes change, it's easy to get suckered in to good old family themes and while not exactly mapped out well, they're very present in \"robinsons.\"", "meet the robinsons. one of my older sisters was interested in seeing it. my mom was interested in seeing it. but i didn't want to see it. from the trailers, it looked like a stupid, childish, bad disney movie. i ended up going because everyone else went. and after i watched it...i wanted to kick myself for ever thinking those kind of things about it. i completely fell in love with it. it was the most amazing movie i have ever seen. right off the bat, i loved the characters, and easily identified with them. the plot is amazing, there are surprises at every turn. the twist is incredible, and you get to really caring about the characters and what happens to them as the story progresses. the robinson motto is incredible, too. the score, by the amazing danny elfman, is great. the songs, particularly little wonders, by rob thomas, are incredible. at the end of the movie, i got all teary-eyed, because the whole thing was really touching. i loved that movie so much, i saw it 7 times before it left theatres. if you have not seen meet the robinsons, watch it. i guarantee you will not be disappointed.", "good animated film. the theme of 'family' was good. the foreshadowing was excellent and made me want to re-watch this (you certainly won't catch every detail on the first run through). the villain(s) were creative and fun. the resolution felt satisfying. the art design was pretty good throughout the movie too - there were very distinct looks to the future, the 'bad future', and the tiny glimpse of the past. while not an exceptionally beautiful film, it doesn't have distractingly poor cgi either. i liked this enough to buy it, although i wouldn't necessarily suggest that for most people. i think this would be good for about an 8 year old or so. there's a short potentially scary scene, but likely on the most sensitive kids would actually get scared.", "i love this movie it's in my top 3 i just hate how underrated it is!!! it's crazy!!!!", "from beginning of the movie, i never know it's about \"back to the future\". i just follow the plot and found the story is brilliant and inspiring. the 3d motion is either, perfect and flawless.i mostly like the quote, \"around here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. we keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious... and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths\". this movie keeps me in line to create many things. just like the motto, \"keep moving forward\".the second, i like the ost by rob thomas, little wonders. it suits the story line. i expect this movie won't be expire for couple years later.", "this is classic in its own right. very capra like in the story telling. tells the story of failure, rejection, and personal responsibility, along with tenacity. so much more than just a kids show, but perfect for teaching lessons to young children and even teens. one of my all time favorite movies.", "good movie, excellent animation and all other technical factors. but hey, the script wasn't so great; the true is it was a little cliché and it seems to be took from another thousands of animated movies (and some not animated ones too), that's why sometimes during the movie i thought i was seeing something i already saw before; but i must say that even with those (insignificant or significant) defects i enjoyed it a lot; it's one of those movies that took me to past (to my childhood), it has that element of adventure and enveloping effects, together they can result into one of the best audiovisual experiences. anyway, i felt relaxed and carefree, something different from my daily routine. i hope you'll enjoy it, watch it with your family and friends, it's good, it's high quality, a wholesome movie and especially it's from disney (i don't know if that's a good reference or a bad one).", "this movie is loud and violent. immediately, upon viewing, my son says \"where are his parents\", and, when i explain, \"will i be in an orphanage?\". sure, it's important for him to understand these issues. but light family fare is no the place to start learning lessons of parental death and separation. disney has been making psyche-altering movies since they killed off bambi's mom - and they haven't stopped since. please consider the message your children are getting when they go see disney films. intelligent characters are isolated and vindictive, strong characters are cruel and aggressive. in addition the action scenes contain \"peril\", which is the mpaa's code word for movies that should be pg. it should be pg,

has many good things and in my opinion nothing bad it also has a very good final scene, it is very emotional in conclusion, future family is my favorite disney movie and that will never change since it has very good and interesting things and much more.", "meet the robinsons might be the most underrated disney movie of all time. some of the other more overlooked disney movies (i.e., treasure planet, atlantis and emperor's new groove) have cult followings, but this movie truly flies under the radar.though the characters are not as memorable as other disney classics and there isn't the nostalgia associated with musicals, there is so much to love about this film. with a clear message of \"keep moving forward\" at the forefront, meet the robinsons is one of the most inspirational disney movies of all time.the twist is brilliant, the humor is poignant (\"everyone hated me!\") and the ending makes me smile from ear to ear.best character: lewis/goob best quote: \"keep moving forward\" (honorable mention to \"that's good joe.\" best scene: the \"little wonders\" final scene.best piece of score: \"setting things right\" best song: \"little wonders\"note: i am outraged that

interesting here, it's just flashing lights and colors to entertain the absolute youngest of children who don't know better. i'd rate a ho-hum boring animated movie higher, because this one made me mentally nauseated.many animated films from earlier years can be looked back on fondness because they were well-written. only an insane person could claim this is such a movie. every single \"joke\" is just some drunk writer's opportunity to ask \"how random can i be?\" it's like someone took and made it into a film.guys that hang out in flower pots. portals that lead up through a toilet. squid butler. singing frog choir. nonsense questions and more meaningless responses make the majority of the dialogue.had to turn it off halfway because we couldn't stand it anymore.i'd recommend this movie only as a masochistic challenge. skip it.", "\"meet the robinsons\" is one of those films that, when viewed through the eyes of a child, awakens a whirlwind of emotions. i vividly and fondly recall the moment when the entire family congratulates the protagonist for his failures, standing out as the most emotional and impactful scene for me. this moment encapsulates a powerful lesson: we learn more from our mistakes than our successes. the film presents a refreshing perspective against the criticisms we often face in life, teaching us that making mistakes is okay because they are an essential part of learning.approaching this experience with a positive attitude, constructive criticism, and sound judgment has the potential to transform us into better versions of ourselves. conversely, the film's antagonist illustrates the consequences of adopting a negative view of life: ending up feeling like a martyr of society when, in reality, the perspective we choose to face life with defines our path.the lesson \"meet the robinsons\" imparts is invaluable and something i will always carry with me. i hope everyone gets the chance to watch this film, especially children. if they grasp and internalize the message conveyed, both explicitly and implicitly, about how to approach life, this lesson will become a valuable mental asset for their entire existence.perhaps on a scale from 1 to 10, this movie might only reach a 6 or 7 considering animation and other aspects like the script. however, i give it an 8 for the significant lesson it teaches children. it's a film that leaves you morally uplifted after watching it, and that is priceless and greatly appreciated.", "when i went to see it in the cinema when i was about 10 i thought it was terrible and boring.if you want to see a great film, buy a dvd from hayao miyazaki.it's just another one of disney's boring films that is soon forgotten. once again, boring and tasteless humour.ever since disney has stopped their films like bambi and the lion king it's become rubbish. i guess it's because 3d animation has come in and it's not special anymore because it's over used. there is never a film with 2d animation

didn't sound so friendly, i had my doubts about this film and i was a little worried that i would not enjoy it. however, the characters are excellent and for once, the baddie is one of my favourite characters in the film!! :) the plot is a a little unoriginal (for example, one boy makes a promise with another boy, the other boy breaks the promise. any familiarity to \"open season\"?), but replaced with some of the best disney characters, disney fun and a really good moral: keep moving forward!taken to the orphanage doorstep as a baby, lewis grows up, not being adopted, as an inventor.

but at the end it gives us such a dense message that i guess it got me and i started to cry. it's not that unusual for me to cry in films, even though doesn't happen that often. and when i cry i always give good grades. the thing here - the story about an orphan kid, who was deeply frustrated about his nonworking invention that took him hours and hours to make, looking for a family - is how lewis became hopeful.the type of themes the movie explores - fear of failure, of loneliness, childhood traumas that can be problematic, fear of being rejected - i guess a bunch of them are deep to me. so while i was doing his trip, i think it went too close to home. and i was mildly enjoying the movie, and finding the robinsons a bit boring, until we understand exactly what goes on.look the movie is not very appealing visually. it's maybe one of the worst disney movies in that sense, it looks too amateurish, even though it has good ideas in terms of scenery. but the animation is clearly disney saying \"we don't care\". however the script is actually great. since the beggining the movie gives you small clues about what's really going on. and when we get there, the characters gain a whole new dimension. what was an absolute cartoonish idiotic villain is now a deep character with a lot of issues that absolutely need a psychologist.that's how smart this is. disney did a \"sixth sense\" that is actually better than the sixth sense. and when we see the results at the end for the kid, when the whole plot comes together, when all the pieces match...jesus i cried. i guess i really liked lewis.", "it wasn't horrible. i laughed here and there. but the story wasn't grabbing me. and after some super lame slapstick comedy, i called it an early quits 34 minutes in (1 viewing, 8/10/2021)",

i'm a little bored but i can still say it is enjoyable. the absence of ridiculous events disturbed me there are too many unnecessary scenes like events that will never happen but the most uncomfortable issue is that the story is easily predictable.you can easily solve many events from the very beginning, almost no surprise it's a not bad animation.", "i loved this film. it had a new direction for disney as they were getting used to cgi and trying out new styles in the 2000s. this is definitely no fairytale story, but rather, a futuristic time travel story. the style is more modern and \"zany\" with lots of characters and gags. overall i quite liked the story and its positive message about aspiring for the future. i think this is actually one of the best disney films of all time, or at least had the biggest impact on me personally.", "meet the robinsons is the best movie i have ever seen this movie is the best just like ratatouille the great movie made in 2007, this movie is about a boy named lewis and his family who really likable characters in my opinion.", "young lewis is an orphan and a child genius, who nevertheless struggles with everyday life, especially with the prospect of getting adopted. not helping the matters is that none of his inventions have worked so far. but then one day he meets young wilbur robinson, who whisks him away on an adventure unlike anything he has ever experienced before.it's the 47th walt disney animation studios feature film and only their second fully cgi-animated one. and it definitely shows. it's not as bad as chicken little, but the textures and the character models have definitely aged less than gracefully, though it has some neat background designs and colours. but, that could be forgiven if the story was good and captivating. it's not. though, to be fair, neither is it offensively bad and the message of determination and endurance is a good one, but the fact remains that the characters are not built well enough for you to care about them. plus, there are way too many of them. the eponymous robinsons family is huge and we get introduced to each and every one of them. only for the film to do nothing with them. absolutely nothing. wilbur is pretty much the only one of them to have any personality or character development beyond the initial quirk.now, that being said, there is one good character in this film. the villain. the bowler hat guy is a lot of fun. not the most menacing or diabolical of villains, but he's a breath of fresh air, being both a coward and a total moron. everything he does in this movie, starting from the way he looks, is hilarious.the bare bones of a good film are here. the late 00s cgi animation lent itself well towards futuristic and colourful designs, the message is a good one and the villain is certainly a lot of fun. unfortunately, they crammed too much in, didn't let the story breathe and in the end ended up with a product that's certainly not worthy of the legacy of the studio, the name of which was once synonymous with magic.", "when you see \"meet the robinsons\" you'll have a choice of seeing it in 3-d or regular. do the 3-d; it's worth the extra two bucks you have to pay. the 3-d enhances an already enjoyable, fun family flick, and makes everything more vibrant and sharp. plus, while most 3-d glasses end up giving you a splitting headache, these do not. and it isn't the normal 3-d where things randomly pop out at you just for the sake of looking cool, no; this kind makes you feel as if you are right there with the characters. the 3-d version is a must, as is the movie itself.\"meet the robinsons\" is the story of a genius young orphan desperate to meet his mother. he is also an inventor, but when one of his inventions gets destroyed by the evil, but stupid, bowler hat guy, young wilbur must go to the future to fix the past. if he doesn't, his entire life will be changed all because of his destroyed invention. while in the future he stays with the kooky, slightly crazy robinson family, and by the end of the film, finds out something remarkable about that family.it is a very well done movie, and actually quite funny. the trailer made it look loud, annoying and not the least bit funny. it does the movie no justice at all. the funniest scenes in the film are with the robinson family, who'll make even your weirdest relatives appear completely normal. there are some parts that drag a little or other scenes that border on tipping the corny scale. nonetheless, minor complaints for an otherwise great 90 minutes of cartoon heaven. it finally looks like disney has done something right. lately all they've been dishing out are inane sequels (cinderella 3?! come on disney, you're better than that). i'm glad they've finally returned to form and made a film that i'm sure walt disney would be proud of. the movie even ends with a great quote by uncle walt. so don't skip this cartoon, it is a excellent film for kids and adults, and i promise you'll be entertained.rated g.", "i think this is one of disney's best animated films! i have already seen the movie twice, and i loved it both times. i love all the characters, like lewis, wilbur, and the bowler hat guy. i'd say this was even better than chicken little, but not quite as good as the emperor's new groove. before the ending, i already thought the movie was really good. but after i saw the ending, it made the movie better than it already was! i also really liked the dinosaur and the plot twists! i'd say that disney has tried so hard to create a masterpiece, and personally, i'd say they succeeded! i'd say when it comes on dvd, meet the robinsons is a keeper.", "so this film has some heart. which is good...because the animation is awful, the characters are inexplicably ripped from a 1950s sitcom, the story is directionless, and i kinda forgot animated movies could be this bad. thank heavens for the pixar merger because disney was apparently really flailing in 2007.", "after a long time, meet the robinsons turned out to be a complete packed entertainer with all that it takes to give a really really good animated movie. i would rate it in line with the incredibles for its futuristic ideas and for humor, its as good as any other anime, like finding nemo etc. the story revolves around a 12yr old inventor who, right from the moment the movie starts, gives you the feeling that he is going to make it big and succeed. but the plot and happenings in this movie, the funny side of it, they all fit in so well and thank you for making it a really really nice feel good movie. the kid in the movie looks cute with his round frame specs on him. the best part of the movie is how the villain's nasty plans come to an end, how the loose ends are tied up and most of all, who the villain is. a must watch movie with your whole family. i give it 10 stars.in short, a family that any kid would love to have. meet the robinsons.", "this is a fine and good and fine film for viewers to watch and enjoy. the storyline was great and full of imagination. the storyline left me a bit confused. the cast selection was great. they connected really well to the storyline and to their respective characters. this film and storyline reveals and teaches viewers a lot in terms of life and careers. this film has multiple aspects of what anyone can achieve in life. this film also makes viewers think about their own lives and the multiple possibilities of what their future might hold. this is an alright fil

digital 3d support). it is a really new experience. 3d effects are wonderful, images are sharp and clear as usual (perhaps only a little less bright, due to the active glasses).digital 3d really adds a new dimension to the film. if it takes two hours of car to reach the nearest digital 3d cinema, it is definitely worth driving.the film itself is ok, clever and entertaining, but 3d definitely improve the viewers experience.", "when i fist saw the trailer for mtr i burst into a fit of giggles at the crazy dinosaur with its \"big head and little arms\". both my brother and father commented that they hoped that that scene was not the best in the entire movie, because they really wanted to see it and not be disappointed. so i hopped to the task of seeing this movie. i gathered up 8 of my high-school-senior/college-freshmen friends and dragged them to see this crazy flick. needless to say, many of them were worried at the idea of seeing a family film. however! by the time the movie started we were already bending and crying with laughter (even more so than the abundance of little kids in the audience). the subtle references and crazy characters kept us entertained throughout the entire movie. and i even forgot about my excitement to see the crazy dino, and was still laughing at that scene even after seeing the preview. so, thank you disney for producing this movie that made my weekend and proved that teenagers don't have to grow up too fast."]}

cinematography. visually stunning. the lead actor is particularly convincing. beautiful chinese costars, exciting pace, keeps you guessing. my only complaint is that the writer/director actually tried to do a little too much with the complicated story. for example, the similarly confusing \"get out\" snaps together into perfect coherence after the last 60 seconds of the movie. in \"battle of

evening.", "battle of memories is quite intriguing ... for the first 5 minutes. after that i'm afraid, it's all down hill. constantly referencing a host of similar - themed, but better, earlier movies (total recall, inception, paycheck etc), it's major problem lies in its foundation plot line premise. in the future people can go to memory centres and undergo procedures to erase some of their memories ... subject to, we find out, a plethora of confusing, uninteresting qualifications, terms and conditions. immediately the alert viewer is asking oneself who would bother then, if it's not a straight forward operation? well apparently jiang feng would.he's a popular author whose wife, zhang daichen has decided to divorce him, for reasons (surprise, surprise!) that are never made clear. so not unreasonably then i suppose, he decides to have his memories of her deleted, a course of action that we suspect may be compromised by a critical incident occurring, just before he leaves the centre. to add to his misfortune, on arriving home, daichen suddenly announces she wants to postpone the divorce (for reasons not explained until the last 10 minutes of the film, in a ho hum twist dramatically better utilised in soap operas such as days of our lives). and things don't get much better despite the inclusion of serial - killers, odd ball cops and copious black and white memory flashbacks (and for good measure, endless variations of same).production standards are admittedly quite good, but overall tone of the film is just plain weird. it's not just the reams of clunky, awkward dialogue that characters are forced to spout (it can't all be blamed on poor sub - title translations.) but the tone of the film is constantly out of kilter. e. g. what's with episodes such as the three stooges like slapstick farce of the cops rolling down the stairs together, in a film supposed to be some sort of sci - fi thriller?for those who manage to stay the course of this dull mess of a film, they'll find battle of memories collapsing into a morass of blindingly stupid coincidences and who cares plot twists. character motivations change directions like the wind to better suit the convenience of the story. the climactic revelation of the killer's identity is obvious, with the only benefit being we now know this banal movie will thankfully soon end.", "battle of memories is

to put on the screen. you're lucky if you find a good movie out of 10. the movie gets 5 stars because it is professional but that draws the line. theres also the requisite pop songs they like putting into movies...dont matter if pop songs dont belong in a thriller movie. they try to sell you everything at one time ...lol. again...a professionally done movie with decent actors but so underwhelming

well done and the idea behind it is rather clever. it is primarily a crime / psychological thriller with just a touch of science fiction having to do with the memory procedure.secondly, i see that for some odd reason, people seem to be downvoting all the positive reviews. i don't understand why ones would do that. but, downvoted or not, i very much liked this film and gave it a strong '8', which fwiw is rather rare for me to rate a movie that highly.something else i really liked was the cinematography and set design. it was fairly subtle and not intrusive or overbearing at all, but just some really nice touches such as the memory center and the guy's office inside it. the machinery used in the procedure, and just the way things were lit and the really textured buildings and the way some of the rooms were dressed. like i say, it was fairly subtle, but i really liked some of the imaginative touches that gave the film a lot of flavour.be ready for some nice twists of course. some of these chinese thrillers do that kind of thing really well and this is most definitely one of them.highly recommended!", "avoid watching it -- it contains too many inconsistent twists and lacks coherence. the story is meagre and boring. what a crappy production!", "i sat down to watch the 2017 movie \"battle of memories\" (aka \"ji yi da shi\") here in 2021. sure, i hadn't heard about the movie prior to watching it, but that was hardly an issue, as it being a chinese movie that i hadn't already seen was sufficient to make me spend the time to watch it.well, watch it might be stretching it a bit, as i gave up on the movie just shortly after having suffered through 1 hour of the ordeal that runs for almost 2 hours. yeah, the movie's storyline was just downright boring and had very little appeal to me. and it didn't help much to sell the movie to me that the characters were pointless and unappealing.this 2017 mystery from writers leste chen and peng ren was simply a swing and a miss. the movie was weighed down by a slow-paced and rather mundane and pointless storyline.and there were no ups or downs along the way as the movie trotted along monotonously with director leste chen in charge. felt like everything was running on auto-pilot, and with no surprises or plot twists, the storyline was just too shallow.as the movie started, i must admit that i was thrilled to see bo huang in the movie, because is a rather talented actor. but \"battle of memories\" was a movie that even he could do so little to lift up. in fact, his performance in this movie was not really noteworthy.i have no intentions of returning to watch the last remaining hour of the movie, as i simply had no interest in the bland storyline or its characters. and my rating of \"battle of memories\" lands on a mere three out of ten stars."]}

the movie in the first half hour of the movie. i started enjoying it. the acting isn't perfect, but i think it's spot-on for this movie. i have never seen bryce dallas howard in this kind of role before. it suits her. they also made a great duo with sam rockwell. the action scenes in the movie are like those in the \"kingsman\" movies, and the director is matthew vaughn, who directed those movies too. i didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, i will definitely go. i have no objection to this movie being a series. one of the reasons i like the movie so much is the cat. alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. i don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were cgi (a few were definitely cgi), but it was very funny and entertaining.", "it's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. such is the case with director matthew vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (bryce dallas howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. the problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. it leaves viewers asking, \"so what's it going to be?\" there's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like \"romancing the stone\" (1984), \"the long kiss goodnight\" (1996) and any number of james bond flicks. while it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring henry cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. \"argylle\" also features a cute, cuddly cat, alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. all of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of sam rockwell, bryan cranston, catherine o'hara, ariana debose, and a seriously underused richard e. grant, not to mention fine turns from howard and cavill as alter-egos of one another. this one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. \"argylle\" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. at this point, though, i think it has its work cut out for it.", "matthew vaughn is one of my favorite directors. he has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: kick-ass, x-men: first class, and kingsman: the secret service. i love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.his last movie, the king's man, was terrible. i gave it 2 stars. but no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. but with argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. it's not nearly as bad as the king's man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. it could have been great.why doesn't argylle work? movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. here are my guesses. first, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. i only laughed once. second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.third, what idiot decided this should be pg-13? there are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. so it feels neutered. they do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. but my theater was nearly empty on opening night. so casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, i was fairly bored and unengaged.but i think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. this is a great cast except for one role. the most important one. the main character. i don't dislike bryce dallas howard. but this was a horrendous casting choice. i can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. it doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. it's not even a tiny bit believable.i still look forward to future matthew vaughn projects. but i just found out that his next movie is a sequel to the king's man. why????? i can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening thursday ultrascreen 2/1/2024)", "have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? argylle belongs to that group - as matthew vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. there's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.when the movie started rolling, i at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. the narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. however, i remembered matthew vaughns genius. what he sold us in kick ass and kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and i had hope argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. the best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. these really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. it's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this moviethe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. everyone does a great job, but sam rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.this fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. they are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. the cgi is often horrific at times too. it shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.ultimately, and despite the movies issues, argylle and it's absurd plot (that i don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. and thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!", "argyllea very hyped movie from the writer of the kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, bryce dallas howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. at first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.the ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though henry cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. dua lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. sam rockwell continues a trend in hollywood where age can be defied as i forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of tom cruise and jason statham.the movie is way too long and needed a better editor. i like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.now, on to the fun. this movie makes the word \"ridiculous\" woefully inadequate. but it's a fun ridiculous. there are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. i don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.there are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. personally, i find that theory worth exploring, because i wonder if i'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. nature vs nurture anyone? people admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. one never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.i enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. don't take the movie seriously, and i believe you will too. the entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.", "first part, i was surprised how much i enjoyed it. i knew that the movie had gotten some bad reviews, but i had not read any of them. and i found myself thinking \"but this is a great, over the top, spy action comedy, what is not to love about that!\".then midways, something happens, and the movie spirals into all kinds of problems.firstly, it drags out for way, way, way too long. from fantastical action and good one liners it turns into a snore fest with redundant, lengthy scenes trying to establish some sense of emotional gravitas. problem is, bdh has zero range, and became nothing but annoying and downright bad at what she was supposed to after.secondly, it bacame clear that it was style over substance. which i one hundred percent can support, if the style is cool, creative, innovative, fun, esthetically pleasing. it never fully was, and it never really committed, becoming a jigsaw of puzzle pieces forced together that really did not fit.thirdly, under utilized actors. lots of great small roles, none got to shine, and especially slj had one of his worst roles for years, mostly reduced to acting like an excited 5 yo in the end.in the end, the movie was somewhat saved by an always fun and excellent sam rockwell. and unfortunately dragged down massively by, i'm sincerely sorry to say, a typically bad bdh. not often i say this but the casting director really picked the wrong main actress with this one.", "maybe i bought tickets for the wrong movie, because anyone giving this 10/10 didn't watch what i did. the first 40 minutes were pretty good, but after that it was garbage. this film is a disgrace to the a-list actors involved and is beyond ridiculous, to the point of lunacy.they overdid the \"crazy plot twists\" by about 3 or 4 too many (i'm not exaggerating), the plot made no sense, they defied the laws of gravity, physics, and logic, the poorly choreographed fight scenes killed my soul, the special effects seem to come from a free app on an iphone, the list goes on and on.i'm pretty easy to please with movies, but this was awful in every way, shape, and form. anyone who says to go in and just \"enjoy the show\" should stick with barbie, star wars 7-9, and zoolander, where that kind of childish mentality and little regard for the plot belongs.if you're looking for a halfway decent action movie with good dialogue, a plot that isn't absurd, visually pleasing fight scenes, and at a moderate length, put this movie at the very, very, bottom of your list. take it off the list, honestly.i will never get those 2 hours/20 minutes (and $5, mind you) back, and i'm begging you to read this and go see another movie.i usually don't care enough to leave reviews on imdb (this is literally the first i've ever written) and that should tell you how awful i feel this show is.", "no, this is not a masterpiece, but if you just wanna have fun and enjoy a movie where you don't have to feel like you're in film study and need to analyze every single scene, then you will have a good time with this movie. i truly do not understand why there are people out there that will only like a movie if it's the greatest movie ever made where every scene is a creation of pure brilliance that must be discussed for decades to come. i guess some people either can't enjoy something unless it's flawless or they're just unhappy and refuse to have fun. if you don't like the movie because it's just not for you, then all the power to you, i have no criticism for your criticism of the movie; we're all different and allowed to have our own opinions and preferences. it's the reviews i see where people are just stating vague things that they say make the movie bad and it honestly makes me feel happy because it reminds me that i'm the type of person who looks for the good, not the bad, and that i can find joy in many things. i hope you enjoy this movie or enjoyed it if you're reading this post watch. if you didn't, but your reasons are honest and true to yourself, then that's ok too. love yourself. love others. bye.", "argylle is a long, dumb, cgi-riddled mess. in other words, it's the standard modern day hollywood movie. some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. there is an abundance of cgi and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. i'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in london because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part i didn't care about what was happening at all. additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. they have you believe that henry cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. those five minutes prove that he would be a great james bond but i bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. additionally, john cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. the rest of the cast is fine and i like sam rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. on the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. i think think the pg-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it rated r would've helped it a bit.. if this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.", "i saw this title at an advance screening and just took my so to check it out before any spoilers got to him. is it perfect? no, what is? is it fun? yes!!i don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. i went in expecting some kind of romancing the stone / 2022's lost city style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but i felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. yes, it ran a tad bit long, but i can't imagine what i would relegate to the cutting room floor.it's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. like aidan says at some point in regards to elly's writing - we don't need another sense and sensibility (or something to that degree). if you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. haters? take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10 anything under a 5? get over yourselves.", "so if you are going into this, you have to know it's gonna be a little campy. similar to the kingsman, there are moments of heart, action, and absolute craziness.some of the scenes were a bit much, but overall this was a fun, and interesting movie. some of the scenes were overly dramatic and we're similar to deadpool's opening scenes as well.the twists in the story were definitely different, came one after another. all of the actors were on point, and i loved the switches from argyle to real life. the worst part was the cgi cat. and i don't think samuel jackson said mfer once. i was shocked.", "spoiler alert: it's not good, it made no sense and i wish i'd had my plums harvested instead of watching it.this was a confusing and irritating experience.bryce was not good, not good at all. sam rockwell seems to be buddies with george clooney in real life, which is fortuitous because now when george cries about his batman movie, sam can relate having been a part of this disaster.caville looked awkward, like he knew how this was going to go over, but was being paid enough to make a sincere effort.sam l jackson does a lazy cameo as whogivesashit, a spy that watches lakers games and overacts.", "matthew vaughn has always been a director i have admired. whether you are talking about his earlier works in layer cake or stardust, or his over-the-top action films in kick-ass or the kingsman films, i have never disliked his work until recently. it was not until 2021's the king's man that i found his work to feel a little stale. that film didn't work for me on many levels, but i have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. well, you can put argylle down as another one of his that i liked. there has been a lot of criticism, but i do not fully agree with it.this is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but i will give it a go. elly conway (bryce dallas howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as argylle. what she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. in comes aidan wilde (sam rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. while this plot goes on, elly sees visions of the main character in her book, argylle (henry cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. what i will say is that this film did not market itself well.audiences see henry cavill, dua lipa, and john cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. some viewers will be bothered by this so i thought i would mention it, but the fact is, i love both sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard and i thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so i was easily able to forgive that. where i will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. it kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though i kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. with that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as i was being a matthew vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because i like how vaughn does silly, i was still in for the ride. i also liked the second kingsman film, so i know this one won't be for everyone. simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things i enjoyed watching, so i can't be overly harsh here. in my opinion, argylle is a good time and i recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.", "candy colored, over the top, action packed fun. this is not a serious movie, by any stretch of the imagination, but a fun, visually imaginative popcorn flick. the cast is solid and enjoyable and the plot is entertaining. i hope apple holds fast and lets this become a franchise, because the world needs more post barbie, bond like romps. if you enjoy movies like big trouble in little china, or the original peter sellers casino royale, this movie is up your alley. i'm always happy to see sam rockwell cut a rug on screen, and if they'd have given samuel l. an f-bomb, it would've gotten another star from me.", "one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i would have walked out if i hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that i'm a fan off. i can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. i didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. i'm not a john cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. there's a post credit scene that came on as i was walking out and i didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way i'm watching a sequel.", "packed in a way that is engaging, argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. but as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. you will become more intrigued. your interest in the movie will be better. it will be anything beyond your expectations. they surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. what started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.there's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. they're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. they knew how to structure the story. it was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. we felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.however, the third act felt... a bit too much. the beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. it was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of kingsman. but came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than kingsman i would say. the tone just fell apart there. it became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'what happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. if only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.another thing that argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. it became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. if you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. this one, not so much.its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by bryce dallas howard & sam rockwell. these two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. bryce and sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. they are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. they don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.while a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. the character played by samuel jackson. his character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. it wasn't fleshed out enough. he barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? for a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.even dua lipa has more screen time than him! or so we thought according to our calculation. this movie markets dua lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. if you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. if only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.there's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. but knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the cgi looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.we also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. the first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. it plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. the transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. it's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.while the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. in our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. it doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. action is great but not 'wow' enough. comedy is there but was pretty bland. there just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. the only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.verdict: what argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. this kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. where argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. but then, matthew vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.", "argylle (2024) : movie review :argylle review: spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. in its first half, argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. there are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. \"that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard in my life,\" yells aidan, aka sam rockwell, and you are like, \"yes! then why the hell do you want us to believe it?\" that's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from a to g to c to z to t to again back to b. that's how messy it is. too many twists make too much of a mess here.argylle is about a spy novelist, elly conway (bryce dallas howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, argylle (henry cavill). for the next book, she decides to visit her mother, ruth conway (catherine o'hara), to brew some new ideas. on the train, she meets a real agent, aidan (sam rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. elly constantly imagines argylle in place of aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. aidan informs elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. she is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka aidan, can get to it. but that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.the writing of argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. that's why you can carry on with it. the idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. the problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about elly, aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. from memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. that's too much. argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. can you imagine that?bryce dallas howard as elly conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after barbie. the idea and standard have both changed now. sam rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. the handsome agent, henry cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. but the role? let me change the subject. bryan cranston and catherine o'hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. ariana debose, dua lipa, john cena, and samuel jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while sofia boutella finds the best space amongst them. alfie, aka chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.on the technical front, argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. the cinematography was good, and the vfx work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. you gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. it was a new experience, despite its stupidity. we aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. argylle fails to understand where to stop. you just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. matthew vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. he could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. as a whole, vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.rating - 3/10*", "i had a fun time watching this movie. although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, i found the imaginative plot quite engaging. the well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. while the movie may not be a contender for the oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.the only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. the movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on dua lipa and henry cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. despite this, both of them did a great job. however, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.all in all, i enjoyed the movie. if you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.", "wow- was this work reviewed by anyone? a generous 2, in fact, i am changing it to a 1. one of worst 3 movies i have ever had to sit through. junior high-level script and layers upon layers of unimaginative fight scenes attempt to make this script entertaining. the book hero concept is not clever, is not well written and definitely does not come to life. lured in with stars like fruit flies to their death in a movie filled with cider vinegar- movie goers have my sympathy. several behind this must have gone into medium length comas as this script isn't fit to put a match to, it probably is too dull to ignite. popcorn with an anesthetic or finding the wrong theater and noise-cancelling headphones wouldn't save this-", "the movie is mediocre for the best part. but the last 30-40 minutes are nightmare. i think that the scenario was written down in an addiction clinic after a dealer broke in. honestly i would give it less then one star if possible. when you look at the cast you cannot suggest the mockery that is about to follow. also the entire movie is filmed on a green screen and the cgi was so bad it would be a shame for any average youtuber. i thought that the computer effects really went a long way in the past years but with this is like they have used a technology from the 90ties. the only explanation would be that they blow most of the budget for the cast and only had 20 bucks for everything else. i will quote jeremy clarkson saying \"top gear top tip: avoid!\"", "\"argyle\" is a funny, silly, spy spoof. it mocks the conventions of bond movies. the plot is completely implausible but it all hangs together, kinda sorta. it involves, of course, international spy conspiracies and lots and lots of twists and turns in exotic locales like london and the south of france.bryce dallas howard manages to play a range of personas of a very complicated character. sam rockwell is just adorable as a laid back, super confident, super competent spy. he's surprisingly sexy and romantic. rockwell is not tall and he's not particularly muscular and he's not super handsome. he radiates scruffy, average guy sexiness in contrast to the tall, muscular, freakishly handsome sexiness of the divine henry cavill.catherine o'hara, bryan cranston, samuel l jackson, and john cena are all really good as ... well, i can't tell you what they play because that would spoil the outlandish bond-ish plot. richard grant and ariana debose are in the movie only briefly but they are of course wonderful.\"argyle\" is violent without being bloody or gory. anonymous hitman are killed and the body count is high, but you don't see any blood. there are martial arts fight scenes. again, this is a spoof and the violence in these scenes is superficial, but yes, there is a lot of shooting. there's a wild shootout scene involving ice skating on a highly unexpected surface - it's not ice. i expected the skater to perform \"the iron lotus\" from \"blades of glory.\"if you are in the mood for pure escapist fare that lets you turn off your brain and you just want to watch stars do their stuff and watch exotic locales and a lead couple with good romantic chemistry, \"argyle\" might be just for you.", "this movie is so god awful that i'm writing this review while watching it in the theatre. we're over 2 hours in and it's still going on - devoid of any sense, logic and/or any redeeming quality. i get that that this is a spoof of some kind (one of those genres) but my goodness, this is beyond terrible. atrocious. i could be getting paid to watch this and it still wouldn't make this torturous experience any less painful.absolute garbage! it's clearly getting on my nerves... i'm not even sure why they have a minimum characters requirement on this because i have to carry on. so i'm clearly encroaching dangerous territory here but this is just help you all. value this feedback and save yourself the pain. bloody hell.", "not sure why there are so many negative reviews. is it an over long film, sure, is it an entertaining film, your damn straight it is. i think all the actors did a fine job and don't deserve the negativity they get in some reviews on here. get yourseves a nice drink, a bowl of popcorn, shut your brain off and enjoy it for what it is, a decent popcorn movie!! if you liked the kingsman films you'll like this. a review is a person's own opinion but sometimes i feel people delve to deep and review popcorn films as if they are supposed to be oscar worthy masterpieces. when i watch a film/tv show the only question i ask is \"are you entertained?\" if so then the film/tv show as done it's job!!", "when it comes to argylle, i'm of two minds on the movie. for most of the movie, i couldn't tell if was plainly one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time... or just dumb fun. my verdict?argylle is a very (very) goofy, but undoubtedly fun film. what can i say? it's dumb... but i kinda liked it. it's a celebration and send-up of the spy genre, but taking things to over-the-top extremes - it's excess is its biggest asset and also its biggest liability. as a certified kingsman fan, i had some hope for argylle. was it fun at times? sure. was it also convoluted and sluggish? absolutely. it lacked the charm of your usual vaughn film - frankly, everything i loved about vaughn's style seemed to either be missing or just feel lifeless and hollow here. for instance, the action looks like what we have come to expect from vaughn, but has none of the stakes, intensity, or emotion. instead, we get a tonal mess where i wasn't sure whether i was supposed to take the movie seriously or not. it just felt like a lot of wasted talent at times. argylle is fascinating because it's a decent movie wearing about four other movies worth of baggage. there's a super fun energetic scene followed by a huge lull, a great twist followed by a long exposition, etc. it felt both overproduced and undercooked at the same time. wildly uneven, much too long, but still enjoyable enough. it worked for me despite not being fantastic. it fits in alongside forgettable streaming films like red notice, ghosted, and the gray man (even down to its bland visuals)... but this is certainly the most entertaining of the bunch, at least for me! basically - if you liked the trailer, you should have fun. if you thought it looked too goofy, you'll think the movie is too goofy. for most, as much as i love the theatrical experience, this movie will work better once on streaming. unfortunately, it really is what you'd expect from a matthew vaughn streaming movie.to end on a positive note, i know this is technically a \"bad\" movie. but i liked it to some extent. so here is my unapologetic final thoughts on argylle:argylle is a film that's both dumb and smart at the same time. it's pure silly spy shenanigans but also has some deceptively smart subtext about the writers-process. it's vibrant, playful, humorous, sexy, and ridiculously entertaining. it is a super fun, slick, subversive action romp. never taking itself seriously, its fantastic cast absolutely let loose. (loved sam rockwell!) there are so many twists and turns, most of which are somewhat predictable, but still managed to be fun. i just wish the reveal of who the real agent argylle is wasn't spoiled for me by a 3-year-old tweet announcing the production of the movie!so did i like it? yes. did i think it was terrible and really dumb at times? also yes.sorry... guess i'm not much help for this one!oh, also, can matthew vaughn please make kingsman 3 already??", "argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from matthew vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. he did this for superheroes in kick ass and for the spy genre in the first kingsman movie. argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. it's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.i don't know what happened to the matthew vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. no matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. the totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and matthew vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.i wouldn't really say i was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. it's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of cgi that frequently took me out of the film. there are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. it feels like ever since the first kingsman, vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. the last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.but like any film other film, argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. there's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. the whole plot revolves around a standard mcguffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. we've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. i had very little investment in the cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but i also didn't find cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. he's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something i'd ever associate cavill with. it felt like they just kept forcing the argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. i liked bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters i found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.i was truly hoping that argylle would be the return to form for matthew vaughn that i've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. i liked golden circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, the king's man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. but neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that argylle exhibited for me. it just feels like vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. i know it's only february but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.", "likes:humor -i enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the vaughn movie.-balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two kingsman did well.music -absolutely one of my favorite elements, vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together -other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-it's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the vaughn feeling behind it that i've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.the fun -like kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-it didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-and yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.the story: -i won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that i very much enjoyed.-a little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.the action to some degree -vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-the early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream rockwell fervor.-near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that i couldn't help but love everything coming together.-if that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.the acting -once again, i'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. he's got the sex appeal of the pierce brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. it's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later) -rockwell is rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. in this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-but howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. she's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.the pace, mostly -and like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-and for much of the film, i admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than i anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.dislikes:the cgi needs work -some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the cgi of the film.-it is not the worst thing i've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of cgi.the action could have been better -argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor vaughn's work is known to have.-where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-and though much of it does become balanced, i can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first kingsman accomplished for me.a few too many twists?-i agree with the reviewers that perhaps fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-they aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for argyllebalancing of actors needs improvement --for me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-rockwell and howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only cavill eking out a few more moments.-true, they all have that memorable factor, but i know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-samuel l jackson, cena, dua lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.the verdict:argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. the primary reason is just vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings vaughn knows how to make come alive. an engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements i loved and found worthy of the theater visit. yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first kingsman for me. the action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. the twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair i know this director can bring. yet, it's the cgi and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. still, i give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so i encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.my scores are:action/thriller: 7.5-8.0 movie overall: 7.0.", "great cast, bryan cranston, sam rockwell, henry cavill, samuel l. jackson, and many other notable names and faces. the movie had potential but swiftly drove off a cliff. you'll keep scratching your head at a lot of what happens. some of the action and fighting scenes were choreographed well. however, the acting and story was poor. the film contradicts itself many times throughout, in ways that are frustrating and ridiculous.if you're looking for a silly movie, with bad cgi, and a loose plot type movie, you're in luck. otherwise, just skip it or at least wait until it's on apple tv or streaming elsewhere.", "if this was the first movie i ever saw, i would never see another. all these talented actors, and all the money in that budget, and all the time i spent in the theater. no spoiler just avoid this for the rest of your life. i am sorry i watched this tonight. i have seen bryce dallas howard act, but not in \"argylle.\" henry cavill is good in everything i saw him in before this, but he might as well be a mannequin made of wood in argylle. sam has made some really terrible stories funny, but this performance is nothing. i never laughed once the whole time. like writers wrote it on drunken bender. heroin addicts are more creative than this hack job.", "argylle, a spy flick, oozes imaginative storytelling with its campy, messy style, dishing out fun like chewing on cotton candy at a circus. it lacked any semblance of real-world logic or realism and made no effort to take itself seriously. in fact, the movie seemed to laugh at its own silliness.this movie had a number of things going for it. for one, it boasted a powerhouse cast including henry cavill in a small supporting role, alongside bryan cranston, john cena, and the brilliant catherine o'hara. bryce dallas howard was perfectly cast as the positively adorable and likable lead character, while sam rockwell seemed content to fill the role as howard's quirky sidekick. with the romantic connection that develops between the two protagonists, argylle feels a bit like watching a little girl's fantastical daydream of her adult self and her offbeat prince charming.unlike some other spy spoofs, it kept the entertainment value high with squeaky-clean content, a colorful style, and intentionally over-embellished cgi. not to mention some really neat music choices. since argylle arguably isn't as dirty as austin powers, as bloody as bullet train, or as witty as monty python, audiences and critics have rejected it. from my point of view however, it maintained a brisk pace, was fun to watch, and never made me sigh, wince in disgust, or feel my intelligence was insulted. i even chuckled a few times until the very end. and, i keep thinking about the movie and wanting to watch it again..or at least some of the cooler scenes again. that's a win in my book.", "it's not funny.it's not cool.it's not heartfelt.it's not gripping.it's not romantic.it's not clever.the many twists are at best bewildering and at worst obvious from a mile away.the action is at the same time dumbly over the top and underwhelming (quite a feat).the cgi is incredibad, so bad it made me wonder if they did it on purpose. the cat especially deserves a mention here, at the same time behaving nothing like any cat ever would in any situation, firmly wedged in the uncanny valley and being intensely unlikeable - also quite a feat for a completely cgi'd animal companion character. nothing about the film would have changed if they had omitted the cat.henry cavill is in it for about five minutes. samuel l. jackson basically plays rafiki from the lion king. sam rockwell seems to be trying to have fun but has zero chemistry with bryce dallas howard who is alternately unreadable and chewing the scenery.i'm just... who was this made for? how did it get made? why does everything look so stupid?", "\"elly conway\" (bryce dallas howard) lives in her remote lakeside home writing spy novels that are going down a storm. her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, \"007\"-style agent perplexes her mother, though. what happens next? well wait til book six would seem to be the obvious answer, but mom (catherine o'hara) insists so \"elly\" decides to take train to visit her parents - and that's mistake number one. onboard she encounters a rather scruffy looking chap \"wilde\" (sam rockwell) who is reading one of her books. she tries to hide her identity, but when he gets to the fly-leaf then her secret is out. that's soon the least of her worries as she and travelling cat \"alfie\" are soon caught up in something straight out of one of her books! she can't fathom why she'd conceivably be the target for any nasty people, but her new found friend soon convinces her that there is someone she has to meet - and pretty quickly she's embroiled in an whole new world of mystery, intrigue and danger! it's a bit of a slow start this film, with a slightly annoying flicking between her real life and those of her characterisations (that's where the \"action man\" style of the sparingly used henry cavill appears) but once we establish who is who and what's going on, we are straight into \"man from u. n. c. l. e.\" territory with loads of rapid-fire escapades that though hardly original, do have some fun twists and turns as we progress to a denouement that is derivative, but still quite enjoyable to watch. the initial concept is quite original and though the execution largely an amalgam of other matthew vaughn features, it still works quite well even if it is far too long, with rockwell clearly having some fun here and the cat remaining largely contained in it's capsule throughout!", "matthew vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as i enjoyed some of works on layer cake, kick-ass, and kingsman: the secret service. argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. the action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. most of the performances were just...fine. bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. henry cavill is just henry cavill.vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.with good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful cgi moments throughout. my god that cgi cat is horrendous. the dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something ai would make.i think it's safe to say matthew vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.", "you absolutely have to just abandon reality and enjoy the movie. while argylle doesn't have the same level of fight scenes, cinematography and soundtrack as the kingsman, it is still a wild and entertaining ride. sam rockwell kills the comedic relief and is a joy to watch. the chemistry between him and bryce dallas howard is lacking but still, a great and fun movie to watch. henry cavill could always use more screen time in my opinion, but the reviews stating he's absent is just not accurate. his presence is equal to that of which his character deserves. ignore the bad reviews and see the movie!!!", "oof, i was looking forward seeing the new film by matthew vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. big mistake. i honestly don't know where to start. so i start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. \"what happened to action movies?\" i have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. if you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. not only is everything cgi like any of the action films netflix churns out by the week. the badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. every time. now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. but this is the whole movie. i could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. and i'm not at the edge of my seat when i see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. hell, even the cat is cg ninety-nine percent of the time. i saw this on regular imax but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' i got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3d to make an extra buck. the schtick with cross-cutting henry cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.i must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a french comedy film (la chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'the long kiss goodnight' (1996) rip-off. but the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. and they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: the actors.i don't want to talk too much about bryce dallas howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. she is a obviously corpulent, which i thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. it makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. but the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but i guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, bradley james allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in vaug's films. more unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like sam rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. i don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. he is worse here than in seven psychopaths (2012). bryan cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, i really want to blame ai for this. scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. we have an exciting scene with sam jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own kingman film). i leave it at that. and want to end with another question. can we please get old school movies back?", "when you hop on a rollercoaster you don't expect to reach any destination but just hold on and enjoy the experience. i don't know what the expectations were from the other reviewers before settling in to view it but mine was for some mindless entertainment, a smattering of comedy and some action.i always love to watch sam rockwell in action and bryce dallas howard was a good foil for him - they actually had some chemistry. the concept did remind me a little of 'romancing the stone' (1984) but this storyline differs greatly.all in all it's a fun roller coaster ride with lots of unexpected twists and turns which fulfilled my expectations.", "taking my seat, i had my fingers crossed that director matthew vaughn (kingsman,) had resurrected his career with a romping good spy story, set against a cracking soundtrack with some great actors.the opening, with a red-hot dua lupa and henry cavil was upbeat, but alas! from the sight of cavill's haircut onwards, it was all downhill.the story introduces the pudgy best-selling spy writer, elly conway, played by bryce dallas howard, (daughter of director, ron howard). presented both as an author and later as a special agent, howard's performance scores low on credibility and high on irritability. unfortunately, she doesn't have the charisma or range to carry the part, but is it all her fault?almost from the opening we're served up the thinnest of premises, that somehow elly's published novels are 'predictive' and so she's become a target for the secret service. thus her 'real' life intersects with her fiction - throw in a pet cat and you have a winner, right? wrong! (the cat-gags might be a high point, but like the film even they wear thin.) there was a great opportunity here, to contrast the difference between elly's romanticised fiction and the gritty reality of the spy-world. but there's the problem, by glamming elly up, and adding in all the 'movie/fiction' spy-effects the story doesn't work. with another director and script this might have been movie gold.henry cavill as elly's fictional character and foil, agent argylle, and the film's namesake, runs himself out of contention for any bond films. his performance is more wooden than pinocchio's - and like his haircut, awkward.as to the plot, it has more holes in it than cheese. scriptwriter, jason fuchs asks the viewer to suspend disbelief so many times that it becomes a lesson in idiocy.were they trying to parody the good-old super spy genre with a twist to every twist? unfortunately, the result is just plain dumb. for example, pudgy elly suddenly becomes a crack shot and hyper-fit operative, even though (according the story,) she's spent the last five years sitting on her arse, eating junk food and tapping out vapid novels.the film uses dance sequences as humour, but mostly they're crudely delivered - a bit like the oil scene, where killer elly, can suddenly ice-skate through it. (but hang on, wasn't the bit about her being an ice-skater just a memory-plant so how did she get the skills, physically speaking? yeah, that's right, most of us can execute a quadruple axel on a whim. and...fyi oil is not ice.) spy, aiden wilde's character should be shot for the stupidity of his dialogue alone; although actor sam rockwell, does his best with the appalling material. one wonders what was anyone was thinking? if they were they thinking at all.just as in kingsman got the pace, soundtrack and acting just right, argylle is the opposite; the music's wrong, the pace is wrong, the acting is embarrassing and the plot is woeful. this was a bit like watching a boat full of leaks, sink - no expense spared and no cgi could save it.resisting the strong urge to leave, several times over, i sat this pointless misery out until i could bear no more. not even veteran actors richard e grant, bryan cranston and samuel l jackson could save this purported 200-million-dollar howler.. two hours and 19 minutes too long, it's not often that one resents the $35 dollars spent on a premium ticket, but if i could, i'd tap at the box office window and beg for my money back.rating: get a refund before you sit down.", "and from matthew vaughn comes argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor plane in january of 2023, argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. i don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard bring their respective a games and there are no complaints there. henry cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. i have to wonder if there is another version of this one where henry cavill has more screen time.at the end of the day, though matthew vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. it's not the worst thing that i've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but i'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. to matthew vaughn i say \"chin up, go get em' next time.\"", "found this movie exactly what it is advertised to be, a fun action packed spy spoof. we found it a great movie with many plot twists and well written and acted. good job to all involved. we don't expect everyone to love this movie but again it delivers everything and more for a wonderful time as a movie fan. there is lots of wonderful moments and suprises. the cast is just great and again delivers in every scene. henry should be the next 007 just based on this movie. i hope they do another movie with the same cast. the screen play is not based in reality but is a fun spoof on many great spy thrillers and does it well. just go see it and enjoy!", "the worst movie i've ever seen! an hour and a half lost of my life.... i couldn't stand it any longer!honestly, it's not even worth leaving a more detailed review. it pretends to be an action movie with some humor, but it is so poorly translated that you don't understand much. the actors from whom i had some expectations, acted so badly, i think that even they couldn't believe that they got to act in such a movie.if i could, i would erase this movie from my memory.the special effects are so bad that you have the impression that they are made as a joke. actually the whole movie is a bad joke. it is not worth watching even for free at home on tv.", "is hollywood so out of touch they would green light something like this? story line is so stupid and cgi is like it was created by a kid in his dorm room. they basically spent the majority of their 200m budget on all big name actors small cameos. and shame on cranston. he's lost a lot of points in my book for this cheap payday. sammy l it's standard, he'll play an umpa loompa if you threw him $20 bucks. same with cena.the only audience i think this will appeal to is 12-13 year old tweens. zero substance, zero continuity, zero suspence. just zero! also why 2hrs10m? could have wrapped this nonsence up in 45mins easily.this honestly isnt even worth downloading illegally. save you bandwidth!", "the film, considering it is a \"comedy\" genre, is funny, has an intelligently developed plot, is well produced and directed, the actors are good... anyway, if you want to have fun, watch this good comedy.it's great to read the comments/reviews too... i can't help but imagine how many nice, sensitive people there are with a good sense of humor, and how pleasant it must be to be around them. on the other hand, when i read other people's comments, i can imagine the kind of people i wouldn't want to have around me.nowadays, it's very difficult to find a good movie. i like any genre, as long as the movie is good... it can even be a horror movie. and the movie \"argylle\" is, without a doubt, a good comedy!", "already wasted enough time on this movie. can't believe i still am.please avoid. its a boring drag which is never ending. was expecting a good story at least, the movie makes zero sense and itnot that i dont like non sense comedy. but this movie is just nonsense and no comedy.all great actors wasted. cavill and cena are there for few minutes and rest of the time you have to bare the horrondous performance of bryce dallas howard. last half an hour was the most painful to watch. the multiple yet unwanted and boring plot twists were never ending. the trailer was so much better than the movie. officially worst spy movie ever.", "i'm actually very into movies especially when it comes to spy movies and althy this was not as good as kingsman but it was not too far from it either, kingsman worked because it did what the 80s and 90s spy movies did... impossible scripts but with a lot of flare, argyle is exactly the same, i had a lot of fun watching it, i'll probably watch it again after some time... this movie for me has a good rewatch value just like kingsman. i'm honestly amazed at the ratings nowadays, bad movies getting good ratings and good movies getting bad ratings... are these gen zs doing this... what in the world is going on!!??", "\"argylle\" is a comedy of spy movies, although it is not a masterpiece, it manages to be entertaining. the script has interesting twists and turns and is well written with the exception of some implausible and exaggerated moments. the performances are good, highlighting that of catherine o'hara. the cinematography is accurate without being novel in any way. the special effects are poorly done in several scenes and that detracts from the film a bit. the best thing are the songs from the film that have quality and move away from the current generic pop. an entertaining film without further pretensions.", "this is a perfect \"turn off your brain and just have fun\" movie! i do not know why it has gotten so much hate when it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously. the movie is not trying to be the next best picture winner at the oscars, so let's all just enjoy it for what it is! it's an over the top silly, goofy, fun spy movie that is reminiscent of the first kingsmen movie in it's charm and humor.bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell give really entertaining performances and their fun banter and chemistry is a joy to watch! the movie also contains lots of twists and turns and while some are easy to see coming, some i was surprised by, which made things more fun, too!don't listen to the haters - this movie is a delight if you go into it with the right attitude!", "thank god i had a free ticket to see this last night because if i had paid i would've been really annoyed. what an absolute terrible movie.what were the cast thinking jumping aboard this train wreck.there was a point towards the end where i found myself laughing, not because it was funny or entertaining, but because i'd sat through it and was just laughing at myself for wasting two hours of my life.it's utter garbage. cavill is literally in it for ten minutes- it's slightly reminiscent

movie, well, it was good. it was funny, had some twists, and was crafted quite nicely-too nicely, in fact.the cast was exceptional, starting with bryce dallas howard, aka the \"jurassic\" lady. despite carrying some serious weight, she looked cute and performed exceptionally well in her role.sam rockwell was surprisingly good in his performance, and the cherry on top was henry cavill.so, all in all, it's a good watch. just go for it.", "the only positive aspect about this film is that it surpassed the other similar film, the lost city, in terms of foolishness, bad humour and senseless violence. in fact the lost city is indeed funny. the plot promised a good spy/comedy film and starting fairly well it soon started to decay with more and more foolish twists ending in an orgy of senseless violence without a bit of taste or reason. the casting was fine but there is not much you can do as an actor with that kind of plot and script. towards the end of the film there was nothing funny, leading to an overacting of the main and support characters giving no opportunity to redeem even a bit the argument or the acting. what is happening to hollywood nowadays? honestly a waste of my time.", "let's establish one basic assumption spy parodies/comedies are a kind of a game. like most games they follow certain rules. the first rule is - trust none - nobody is what he/she claims to be. another rule - there will be gadgets. one more rule is - laws of probability don't count. i could list a few more rules but these will do for now.matthew vaughn is determined to get the top spot in this game. he competes against everybody, and he's going to win. see his kingsman franchise, with two more installments promised at this moment. and argylle, should the box-office be favorable will be another such franchise. these franchises may not reach the length of the ultimate spy franchise james bond, but they'll compete in any other aspect and will leave nothing but dust in their wake.once you realize the entire thing is a game, most of the silly spectacular stuff will start making cinematic sense. the macabre fireworks show toward the end of the first kingsman installment is just a prequel for the colorful smoke show, or the oil skating show we get in this movie.we get a super cast to support this game show, with the ever-dependable sam rockwell and bryan cranston with the no less dependable catherine o'hara, with vaughn's regulars like samuel l. jackson and sofia boutella. and with a very good performance by bryce dallas howard who captures both aspects of her character to the teeth.i loved it, including all the necessary plot twists. if you know what to expect you won't be disappointed.", "this movie was two hours long and twenty minutes?somehow that's not enough time to explain the movie.1) what the main characters' life was like, what her family and friends were like. just her life, home, an atmosphere to absorb, etc. i think this movie would have done better and meant much more if we had a more intimate setup to relate to and care about and understand the main character.2) then, this movie wasn't an obvious comedy to me. but, i think it was going for a campy, silly feel of sorts in a round about way. some like the humor and fun. i think there is a time and place for that. i believe this movie would have done better if it was more emotionally gripping and serious after introducing the main character's like in more intimate detail. which they didn't do. this character's life could have been fuel for a more sentimental, serious and emotional movie. i think it would have worked better.3) the plot wasn't very clear until way far into the movie. it was just kind of a lot happening and not really understanding why or vaguely understanding why that was. it made the movie less interesting and kind of weird to watch. a better build up or explanation of the plot would have helped earlier on. it's like watching a game without knowing who is playing. it makes it less interesting. many fight scenes for some vague unknown reason.i think the plot premise and characters offers a very interesting set up for a movie. this movie had a lot of potential.the scenes even. different rooms, different villains, different environments, etc. they were cool looking and had potential. but, it was too shallow without depth so it didn't develop any layers to make the cool looking scenes more impactful.there were almost touching or cool moments between main characters but without the proper buildup or development to it, the mark was missed.i believe this movie would make a very good book, something that has time to give the emotional buildup and background to it.there maybe just wasn't time in this movie for it. maybe this movie would have been better as three movies. a movie with two sequels. and i say it would have hit better as a serious and emotional movie. but, i can think of adam sandler's movie fifty first dates that had the emotional depth and the humor. maybe they could have gotten the people who wrote that movie to balance emotions that are serious and humor.", "my wife and i watched argylle (2024) in theaters

steel), bryce dallas howard (the help), sam rockwell (seven psychopaths), bryan cranston (breaking bad), john cena (peacemaker), and samuel l. jackson (pulp fiction).this movie is a complete disaster. it's been a long time since i've seen something this bad. despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only sam rockwell's character being hit or miss. bryce dallas howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. the final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring samuel l. jackson's wine analogy falls flat. henry cavill and john cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. the ending hints at an \"argylle/kingsman\" apple+ tv series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?in conclusion, argylle is a disaster for apple+ tv, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. i would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.", "i loved every minute of it! it was so fun. i love spy comedies and the humor was a huge feat for this genre. they pulled off a lot of genres actually like action was great and romance. good job! i think the actors are amazing too like wow not a single bad performance. these actors are on a whole nother level... give them all the awards! love the film industry once again pulling off the impossible! 12 out of 10 stars! what else to say? they went above and beyond. the script was great, dialogue was perfect, the characters were like superheroes. just incredible all around. they deserve all the accolades. i would love to see more fun spy movies like this but i'm so happy with this. like what else is there? it was perfect! it was under appreciated but that's okay. i liked it and enjoyed the twists and turns. it could even be classified as adventure because the hero finds herself very far from home and still manages to be badass! and did anyone see that dance scene?! its probably a dance move in real life but its just so silly. lol comedy gold!", "we wanted something

regrets.", "the film starts off decently. though as it progesses, it turns exhaustingly into a poor comedy. it tries to subvert expectations so often that it gets lost in itself and becomes a joke.

what she has to work with for the film. though this shows that vaughn should stick with kingsman and it's r rating, instead of trying to expand the universe with this. the lack of practical stunts is also apparent right in the opening scene. we are spoiled with actors such as tom cruise doing things practically that it is easy to tell when cgi is being used. overall it is a mediocre film that had potential, though wasted the talent of the cast.", "sorry but no, even actors should intervene and say hell no, it's ruining their careers.cgi upsets more and more people every day, i'm glad i'm not the only one, bad cgi is a turn off, and there's no explanation why they would rather rely on cgi than do it with stunts or practical effect rather than with a cartoon replacing the person.it upsets me so much, i couldn't even finish.if i want to see a blend of cartoons and people i would rather watch, who framed roger rabbit? a hundred times than going into this atrocity.i'm sorry for the

the first 15 minutes of this film (i can't be sure, it felt like hours). only when sam rockwell appears does the film have any vitality or purpose. the best comparison would be the beginnings of ishtar or joe versus the volcano, where the audience is browbeaten by the setups that, respectively, two cabaret performers are horrible at their jobs, and joe has a dreary, fluorescent-lit basement job. and we, the audience, are driven to share their despair. here, the audience is presented, a la 'romancing the stone' (a much better film, btw), with a live action performance of a meek writer's story. and, as exaggerated as it is, it just goes on too way long, over-egging the cgi and vfx cakes, as it were.the problem is, it's not entirely clear how much is meant to be serious and how much is legitimate parody of ridiculous action from the kingsman series (obviously a matthew vaughn inside joke), or even 007. it's probably better than those examples, but not good enough be be a good movie unto itself. even the outrageous set pieces in the final half hour are so baroque as to suggest parody, but yet still oddly wish for the audience to take them seriously. the movie is, to its credit, honestly self-aware of its frivolousness. but it is hopelessly predictable in the sense that it's timing of seemingly unexpected twists is so obviously precise, that there is never really any jeopardy attached. we know how it will end. (and who will be there at the end... no spoiler).so, does sam rockwell salvage the project? partly. i enjoyed enough of what he does onscreen that every other bit of wasted talent and trop-ish casting could be forgiven. and yes, he dances.", "this is probably the worst movie i've ever seen. i was tempted to walk as some other did, but always hope something worthwhile will happen. this was almost three hours of relentless moronic silliness. i feel sorry for most of the cast but then again i'm sure this was a money grab for all of them. they've all made the rounds of morning and evening talk shows. i actually feel sorry for the well publicized cat who has had a lot of visibility on the tv commercials for this travesty. i was so turned off i wasted half of my popcorn-a major sacrifice for me. run, don't walk away from this movie. seriously.", "this isn't a movie you're supposed to take that seriously. lots of people are critiquing the tropes and picking apart the movie as if it's some

laughs. great action sequences that felt fresh. every actor did a fantastic job. especially bryan cranston and henry cavill the most fun i've had at the theater for a while. if you're a fan of matthew

quite possibly the worst screenplay ever written, and the film felt even longer eternal. just when i thought it couldn't get any worse, surprisingly it found a way to do so.i admit that i'm seldom left speechless, but in this case, i can only echo the sentiments of my irish friends: it was, to put it bluntly, absolute s****.but hey, if you're an aspiring screenwriter, take heart - if argylle made it to the screen, there's hope for anyone. go on, i dare you to try and do worse.", "argylle is a movie that seems fresh given the story. it is not a traditional spy film. aspects of the film are fun. the story beat is fantastic each scene building on the next through each act as the character arc sweeps you away. the soundtrack is a wonderful edition to this film. each scene the music goes perfectly and plays your emotions allowing for a deeper enjoyment of the film. the only downfall of the movie is that the comedy seemed far and in between for a comedy. they missed a perfect opportunity in creating this film as an actual action / thriller. it could have become an iconic spy thriller in the style which it could have been written. however, if you are into the spy / espionage style film then gives this movie a try.", "it's a ridiculously entertaining wanna-be spy movie. trying to push the limits of plot-twist and spy cliches except they're pushing it a little too much. but it's amusing in its own ways.if you combine the plot twists of the bullet train but cringy, camera angles and editing of scot pilgrim vs the world but a little bit sloppy, and just a drop of scotsman: secret service action sequences and \"presentations\" you have argylle.we can't blame ourselves for the high expectations as the thriller and casting is impeccably wrapped... until you realize it's an apple movie so yeah...they have all the money to do whatever ridiculousness they ever wanted.", "i just wasted so much time, i would rather lick the bottom of a public restroom floor

entertaining to watch paint dry than watch this movie. i am genuinely considering killing myself and this movie is the reason for it. i could have been getting motion instead i watched a movie that i have no idea that was even happening. the problem of global warming is better than this movie. if you watch this movie you will commit suicide.", "i couldn't figure out if this was a movie for preteens or for adults. and it turned out it was neither. if they would have removed the bad language and some of the violence it would have been perfect for middle school age kids but they added it on to make it appeal to adults and it really wasn't that appealing. it's worth the matinee price if you're looking to kill a couple hours but it did not come together as a movie and it really had potential. i was hoping to like it and there were a couple fun scenes but i might advise you to skip this and wait for next month when some good movies are coming out.", "there, i've said it. had time to kill on a sunday evening, read the reviews on imdb and elsewhere and reckoned it had half a chance of entertaining me for a couple of hours. sadly i am really losing my ability to pick a decent movie to watch. this was one of the most dreadfully boring and ridiculous movies i have ever seen. the story - was there even a story? - was awful. disjointed, unfunny, meaningless. the acting was so bad. the special effects were, well, loud and went on far too long. this film apparently had a huge budget, but i would be amazed if they take anywhere near it - wish they hadn't had my hard-earned cash.", "this film is a perplexing mix of a fictional spy plot and a writer battling anxiety while crafting a book. the constant shift between henry cavill/john cena and sam rockwell/bryce dallas howard feels completely irrelevant. the action sequences are disappointingly subpar, and the unnecessary character switches only add to the confusion. the character development and plot focus are lacking, making the movie a jumble of nonsense. despite the dizzying twists and turns, there's some enjoyable comedy, resulting in a hit-or-miss viewing experience. entertaining, but chaotic plot shifts. did you enjoy watching it?", "zero connection to any aspect of the film. waste of time. humor is off. acting is cheesy. way too many lame plot twist. great cast who have all had individual great films however this collection is an epic fail. samuel l jackson does better in capital one credit card commercials. terrible action scenes. the film in question struggles on multiple fronts, from its disjointed narrative to its lackluster character development. the plot feels like a patchwork of clichés, with predictable twists that fail to engage the audience. the storyline meanders without a clear direction, leaving viewers perplexed rather than intrigued.one of the major pitfalls lies in the characterization. the characters seem one-dimensional, lacking depth and complexity. the dialogue feels forced, with exchanges that often come across as unnatural or contrived. it's challenging for the audience to connect with the protagonists when their actions and motivations remain ambiguous or inconsistent throughout the film.moreover, the film's pacing issues contribute to its overall sense of dissatisfaction. scenes linger unnecessarily, dragging out the runtime without adding substance. conversely, crucial moments are rushed, leaving viewers feeling disoriented and disconnected from the unfolding events. this erratic pacing disrupts the flow of the narrative, making it difficult for the audience to become emotionally invested in the story.the cinematography and visual effects, too, fall short of expectations. poorly executed cgi and lackluster cinematography contribute to a visual experience that fails to captivate. scenes intended to be visually stunning or climactic end up feeling lackluster and underwhelming, undermining the potential impact of key moments.the film's soundtrack, while forgettable, further highlights the overall lack of cohesion.", "\"argylle\" is a nice pick for an evening if you still remember how to have fun. i don't understand people bashing this movie, as it clearly gives up it's basically a typical spy parody film in the trailer, so need at all to expect anything too serious or intricate from it. it's hilarious, the actors are awesome (though all of cavill's hairstyles were diabolically bad), maybe except for john cena, who's being... you know, john cena. i love how catherine o'hara keeps on her lifelong line of playing mother figures. bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell are just pleasant and good to watch together. so sit back, chillax and leave your criticism and hard feelings outside of your coach.", "sam rockwell just does what he usually does: outplays everyone around him in any movie he is in. this one is not an exception. although the project is headed by henry cavill, he is just a footnote after all. the real stars are the man forementioned, and bryce dallas howard (who is not in her best form, if you know what i mean). the story is fine for readers and fantasy lovers, but way far-fetched for viewers accustomed to reality. but, hey! who cares? imo, it is a project aiming to brake us away from our everyday bad and forget all of that for two hours. it is silly, no brain cells needed. just have fun and enjoy the ride.", "the lines between fiction and reality blue for writer elly conway, who seems to have an uncanny nack of predicting real life events in her argylle

official trailer of the movie i liked it and i had high expectations about it, even though i was sure it was gonna be just another typical movie. eventually, it was as good as i had imagined and i

the same, just saying... the storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though there were some plot holes. the characters were interesting, well-developed and likeable (except, the villains). the casting choices were great and their performances were descent. by the way, dua lipa deserved more screening time! gladly, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and the fight scenes were perfect (especially, the intro fight scene, the colorful dance fight scene and the skating fight scene). also, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done. the opening scene was probably, the best part of the movie mainly because it was filmed in greece (yay!) and because it was very intense and promising. the 2nd act was full of iconic fight scenes, plot twists and it was really enjoyable. the 3rd act was great, but the ending scene was kinda confusing. overall, \"argylle\" was a nice spy movie, adventurous, kinda funny and i would probably recommend it to my friends!", "people are writing reviews revealing the scenes that were the last nail in the coffin and they walked out. i may confirm that i walked out before any of these scenes people are

got to dance. but he should fire his agent.without revealing much of the plot, howard's character is a writer whose main creation is a hero of spy novels. very quickly, her life is interrupted by a real spy that comes to her rescue.. as he takes action to save her life, the film slices between images of the real spy taking down bad guys with the fictional hero (as our heroine comes to terms with how fantasy has given way to reality). for the creative decision, whoever signed off on continually splicing the two men back and forth should be deported to fresno and never given access to the general public again. that was annoying.oh, as was the bitter understanding that the overall film was as formulaic as hollywood and not worth further discussion:austin powers (1997) x cloak and dagger

then fixed up pretty much every plothole that resulted from pulling that stunt (not all of them, but pretty much all of them), its also a writers movie, because from the \"suspension of disbelief\" to the \"deus ex machina\" in the end (saved at the last possible moment), narratively it flows with ease.and its also a writers movie, because in the layered in allegorical storytelling it tells a coming of age story. rebellion against your parents, overcoming selfdoubts, up until our hero is established, to then just fall back a little on the nerdy, quirky and silly side, to give our hero back the humanity. its stacked full with motives of selfrejected love, anti-bodyshaming, but also with included male hunks, isolation, male/female role reversals, fossile fuel industry bad tropes and all

hooked me just with that. twice.the rooftop chase scene, and the smoke dancing scene later on. i couldnt help but to laugh fully, openly an honestly during both of them. and when i did, i laughed with

story sounded good. sadly, the characters lack chemistry. the cat is horrific. and please just head off to the restroom when it comes time for bryce to ice skate through the bubbling crude.", "i would start with: my rating would be -10 but the app is not allowing me to do this. i was so amped to watch this even if i saw that the general rating was 6 stars.this one made me write the first review as is the worst movie i ever saw in long time.. and made me get out after 10 min's.its a waste of time and money and don't get hyped by henry cavil and the cast ...it's a trap!i went especially for cavil and i tought it's gonna be a cool one but no! the cgi is so bad and the dialogue even so. i feel really sorry for cavil but this movie and i couls not believe he accepted to do this fiasco.", "if you go into this with the right attitude it is pretty funny and hilarious. i love bryce dallas howard and she was a pleasure in this movie. it got a little confusing about 2/3 in and none of us watching were totally sure what was going on. we thought it was billed in a different way than the story turned out to be. that said it was a fun family movie to watch with our young teens and they were correct that a couple scenes were totally cringe. we thought maybe at the end they were setting it up for a sequel and we thought \" oh please god, no\" but as a stand-alone movie it was funny and entertaining.if you're watching with kids there is one f bomb.", "i don't normally write reviews. this is solely due to the abomination of a movie/concept. yeah. well since i have to fill out these characters. i might as well just speak my mind. this movie really gave us so much and offered so so little. another example of how a bunch of a list actors can't just carry a movie. especially one with the worst writing, on screen chemistry, even the cgi was horrible (not surprising unfortunately as we know how cgi has only been getting worse). i still have more writing space. i wish i could just go all out but i want people to go watch this and see how bad film can be.", "5 out of 5 stars.argylle is an awesome spy action comedy film that is over the top fun, cheesy, and very entertaining. director matthew vaughn sets up another big spy action franchise with creative and stylish action. of course the action may be cheesy and fun. its why we usually go to the movies is for pure escapism.the plot is great. the plot changes direction mid way after twist after twists and best to see for yourself without reading about it. the trailer does a great job without revealing too much. it does set up a new franchise for the spy action genre.it has a great cast ensemble. bryce dallas howard was wonderful in the role. along with sam rockwell. henry caville and john cena were great in the roles.the script and direction is filled with energy and style. the action sequences are over the top fun. it has humor. it is exciting. the soundtrack tries to make it entertaining. the visual effects are okay and can be cheesy. its not matthew vaughn strong area with his films.overall, if your looking for a blockbuster escapism. this is the film that will entertain. and has a mid credit scene that sets up the franchise for more to come.", "wasted 2 hours of my life on this trash. started out somewhat interesting and got exponentially worse towards the end. neither funny nor entertaining. i'm embarrassed for high caliber actors that decided to participate in this garbage movie. no plot. the only good part of this movie were the first 30 seconds containing dua lipa which the audience was tricked into thinking she was part of the movie. considered walking out a few times which i've never done but decided to stick until the end. that was a mistake. horrible cgi, bad acting and a plot made up by a concussed person on heroin while smoking pot and during jack. save 2 hours of your life!", "is argylle completely ridiculous? yes. but is it a lot of fun? also, yes. this semi-satirical send-up of spy flicks brings together an ensemble cast to continuously (and literally) wink at the camera to let you know that it knows what it is. and behind the bombardment of high-energy action sequences is an engaging story that continually keeps you guessing. however, the film features so many twists and turns that it may cause motion sickness. also, despite the large budget, some of the visual effects are distractingly cartoonish. nevertheless, i wouldn't mind seeing another installment of argylle.", "argylle is further proof that mathew vaughn is a director of style. you can always rely on his films to have some visual flair and stylish action sequences. how good the films actually are can vary wildly and argylle is pretty much slap bang in the middle of his filmography quality wise.bryce dallas howard plays elly conway, a writer of spy fiction who is so good at predicting espionage antics that her books have actually described the real antics of a shady renegade group of agents who know want to abduct her to gain the inside track on a missing computer drive that could expose them. trying to keep her out of their clutches, and recover the drive himself, is good guy spy sam rockwell.the movie is actually a fairly different from the one many people may have expected based on the trailers. henry cavill is in the film as square haired super spy argyll (along with his even more musclebound sideman john cena), but only as part of elly's thoughts. this mainly boils down to an opening sequence and a few action scenes that cut between rockwell doing whatever he can to off the bad guys and cavill effortlessly dispatching them in elly's imagination, a total of 10-15 minutes screen time. what we actually get is something of an action rom-com focused on dallas howard and rockwell. while this may annoy those who came to see the former superman its a nice change of tone for vaughn compared to a kick ass or kingsman film. the smooth action remains but out go the crude jokes and blood in favour of a pretty sweet storyline of saving the day together.said storyline is, on the one hand, a basic globetrotting (or standing in front of a green screen) mcguffin chase but the twists come thick and fast. barely fifteen minutes ever goes by without a reveal of some kind and while they vary in effectiveness and logic the frenetic pace means the film never feels like it is coasting. still, come the final credits you may be left wondering exactly what was going on, especially after a bizarre final revelation and mid credits scene that either reframe the movie or are completely meaningless.carrying the film through even the least convincing stretches are the stellar cast. bryce dallas howard has screen prescience and likability for days and gets to show off some range. sam rockwell is such a natural in a role like this you wonder why nobody has been able to tempt him to do more of these kind of movies. together they have great chemistry and their unfolding relationship carries the film. they are ably assisted by a supporting cast including the like of catherine o'hara, bryan cranston and samuel l. jackson.to say everything about argylle completely works would be an overstatement and it doesn't come together as well as vaughn's best, but if you're in the mood for a fun, twisty slice of action anchored by two charismatic leads then you could do a lot worse.7 grumpy faced cats out of 10.", "this movie is of a kind that we lack these days a lot. it is lightweight and entertaining. it does not pretend to be deep and thoughtful (thank you for this), it just provides pure and ridiculous fun.but i disapprove the use of now and then song. it is absolutely unnecessary here, and the cultural significance of the release of the last song by the beatles is way, way higher than the significance of this movie. i have no idea how they even managed to use the song when it was released on november 2023 and argylle release was february 2024, only four months later. but somehow they claimed that the characters heard it at least 5 years earlier - what is it for? there are plenty of songs that could be used for the movie's purposes, no need to invent facts about the titans' last song.", "spy novelist bryce dallas howard is on the train to go see mom catherine o'hara about the ending of her latest opus. shefinds herself and her cat under attack by all the passengers save sam rockwell. he rescues her, explaining that her novels are prescient in their ability to predict which going on in the world of spies. so it's off to london.i believe it was pauline kael who noted that if you don't like bad movies you don't like movies. also, people i respect told me that the movie is pretty much a stinker. as a result, i was only mildly disappointed by this effort, which started out as a well-presented fantasy, but soon degenerated into one of those mish-moshes in which everyone is a deadly spy, akin to imagining the next john wick movie, which has to outdo all the previous ones. director matthew vaughn seems to have had some hope of another in this series, but word of mouth seems to have put the kibosh on that ambition.it's not that the acting is poor. it's not that there aren't several scenes which are quite engaging. it's not the scottish fold cats are not cute. it's that by the time the movie is half over, the sheer cloud-cuckoo-land architecture of the plot piled atop castles in the clouds of miscasting had sent my brain into stern denial of any of this being worth looking at it. fantasy depends on the willing suspension of disbelief, and you couldn't get me to suspend my disbelief with a power drill at my ear and all my parents' descendants locked in a room with a bomb. it's not that i wouldn't want to, it's that i couldn't. and i don't think you could either, not if you have any self-respect.", "this is comedy / satire / parody , but this is not listed on imdb. it say spy / action / thriller. no, fist is spy comedy and much less thriller. it has twists, perfect perfomance by sam rockwell, it is highly entertaining without making stupid faces to try make people laugh. i got some good laughs how silly it is at some moments. cadt is good but sam is thenling in this movie. he could do real spy / undercover agent movie easy. many scenes are crazy unrealistic but not as much as in

story line is good until halfway through and then it just gets stupid. the soundtrack in the last twenty minutes completely ruin the scenes. if are looking to laugh at a bad movie - this for you, otherwise don't waste your time. in no way is this the actors fault, just the writers. the storyline goes in twenty thousand different directions and then contains any movie cliche you can think of.

have ever seen. i love it.i am not allowed to leave a review that short so i'll just reiterate the above statement. after all, i am a person who likes to be concise and this minimum character rule

above a very mediocre direction and editing, average acting, weak story, and you are only left with nice cinematography.the movie seems to drag from the very first scene.drag drag drag, we get endless

disappointed for was that henry caville and john were in it for not very long,action secenes were pretty cool, i dont get why people give it such a low mark ouit of 10 those people dont know a fun and

over rooftops in a succession of improbable angles. unlimited henchmen. as imaginary characters, john cena and henry cavil shone. sam rockwell did his usual convincing job. a great actor always.the

they miss the point.this is a leave your brain at the door and just go with the flow movie. some of the cgi (compared to what we've become accustomed to) is a wee bit hokey at times but it doesn't distract from the action.fwiw i want to address some of the comments i read about bryce dallas howard? there are mysogynistic a** holes everywhere you look these days. she's a very lovely woman, sexy as heck, but forget all the comparative nonsense you may read elsewhere, the important thing is she's really good in this, movie and adds another string to her acting bow.sam rockwell doesn't disappoint, is there a more watchable actor alive? maybe, but he's having a lot of fun here. they all are!it's a very watchable, has the distinctive mathew vaughan visuals, and is not as ultra violent

are no hints of logic and adherence to the rules of the world, the graphics are cheap, the staging of the fight scenes is facepalm, the humor is not funny for the most part, the same star cast is here

cringe...", "this a fun movie, period. yes it gets absurd towards the end but even the haters can't deny that overall, argylle is a fun movie. let it take you on the absurd ride that it is and just enjoy it. the entire cast is great as well, cavil playing the perfect fictional spy master along with the real spy master, rockwell. also not bad from bryce dallas howard either. did not stay for the post credit scene (didn't know about it) and it looks like maybe sequel in the works? who knows. i do know that the haters are certainly going to hate this movie. too many movie snobs out there. the only real negative thing i can say is that it felt longer than the 2:19hr.", "this movie could be a fun and satirical take on spy films. but a few things affect this film deeply. firstly, when the trailer includes all the best scenes of the movie, it raises the viewer's expectations, only to leave them disappointed when the actual film lacks any remaining interesting elements. secondly, it was disappointing that henry cavill, dua lipa, and john cena had very small roles. thirdly, the final 20 minutes of the movie were subpar. it would have been acceptable if the movie had concluded when the plot was revealed. fourth, the movie's fantasy begins from an interesting point, but as it progresses, it becomes increasingly childish.", "it's so over the top and it just kept climbing.more twists than something really twisty.ron howard's daughter slaughters this role.henry cavill and his high hair are comedy gold.sam rockwell's acting chops are the anchor for this swinging chandelier of a

fun. me & my son really laughed. but the send half, it was still ok but it seemed like it dragged a bit. sam rockwell, as ever was fantastic & so was bryce dallas, she always looks great but she looked absolutely stunning in this film! can't understand the negative reviews. it's still a fun bit of silliness, which is always good. henry cavil is so funny & his hair alone is it's own character! my son loved it & i happily watched along. i felt both lead actors matched well & equally good in my eyes, just a bit off the second half, i felt more an editing fault rather than acting or storyline problem. still worth a watch & i think it's my sons new favourite movie!", "full disclosure i will watch any movie sam rockwell (\"aidan\") is in, because he has great comedic timing and more depth than a shakespearean actor.he stars in director matthew vaughn's spy-themed universe (through his marv studios) in what starts off as good, goofy fun, change of pace from vaughn's usual r-rated \"kick-ass\" and \"layer cake.\"vaughn himself says he wanted to make a movie his young daughters could see...sure they could watch it, doesn't mean they'll understand this bond on lsd inspired flick.vaughn is all about this universe being interconnected and comprising the \"kingsman\" franchise with the argylle films, and an unnamed third franchise...apparently.it is a bloated movie that can be exhausting to keep pace with.\"argylle\" has enough enjoyable moments to help you forget it's messy and mostly good fun.vaughn cast henry cavill as \"argylle\" because he needed someone who was born to play james bond.cavill was a finalist to play \"bond\" in casino royale (2006), but was rejected for being too young (22 at the time).this is in fact henry cavill's fourth spy film.the other three are: the cold light of day (2012), the man from u. n. c. l. e. (2015) and mission: impossible - fallout (2018).even the director describes this movie as his ode to 1980s action movies like \"die hard\" (1988) and \"lethal weapon\" (1987), with plenty of \"bond\" sub flooring.bryce dallas howard as fiction author \"elly conway\" named taylor swift as an inspiration for her character.howard's reasoning?, \"she is a cat lady. she's got this awesome backpack with a cat in it that she walks around with. she loves a good argyle sweater, and there is a sort of unapologetic dorkiness about her.\"no argument from this critic.\"alfie\" the cat is played by chip, actually owned by matthew vaughn's wife supermodel claudia schiffer.if she'd married one of the \"thunderbirds\" instead she could have become claudia schiffer-brains. (couldn't resist the bad dad joke.)the cast features two oscar winners in rockwell and the first queer woman of colour to receive the statue in an acting category (\"west side story\") ariana debose.it also has two oscar nominees in samuel l. jackson and bryan cranston.remember samuel l. jackson starred as the sociopathic villain \"valentine\" in matthew vaughn's spy movie: \"kingsman: the secret service\" (2014).the star studded cast also includes richard e. grant, whom i follow on twitter because he's such a talented human being, singer dua lipa as \"lagrange\" (a tribute to rockers zz top) and catherine o'hara (\"home alone\" and \"schitt's creek\")just for the record \"argylle\" is named after the argyle diamond design that originated in scotland and features strongly in the credits and the movies poster.coming in at around $200 million, this is matthew vaughn's most expensive film, and the most expensive film produced by apple, tied with killers of the flower moon (2023).what have i learned from \"argylle\"?\"vascular corridor\" is a real thing and you don't want to get it wrong!watch out for:the train sequence (strongly influenced by \"bullet train\"), the mini-moke californian chase scene, plus the ice skating on oil scene and the very colourful corridor smoke bomb shoot out.\"argylle\" has lots of moving parts.the recently released found beatles song, \"now & then\" features heavily and sits well in the soundtrack along with another track during the closing credits that would be right at home in \"skyfall\".just like the evergreen stage production agatha christie's \"mousetrap\" once you know the secret don't let the cat out of the bag.\"argylle\" has more twists than a packet of \"twisties\" (a cheddar flavoured snack from smiths)...because life's pretty straight without twisties.as they say so often in this movie, \"the greater the spy the greater the lie\" and i'd be lying if i said this was matthew vaughn's finest hour, because it's not, but it is an entertaining, laughter filled way to spend over 2 hours at the cinema.stay for: \"argylle's\" post-credits scene which is a neon sign pointing directly to vaughn's massively popular series of kingsman films.", "this in addition to napoleon and any other apple made movie i've seen.enough is enough.nearly every scene is done on a green screen so there's some cheap looking static cgi background, so you feel like you're in a series of zoom calls, even when there is motion they look so poorly done, comparable with 1000's of cheaply made youtube videos.the only difference is they use their huge budget to bring in big stars to draw interest in their movies but i guess this is why they don't promote it being an apple movie until it's too late and you're already committed to watching.they take the opportunity to showcase as many apple products as possible in such an obvious way, it's pretty frustrating, let alone their plots are all over the place.literally every single time i see \"apple movies\" or whatever they're called at the start of a film, i immediately think should i suffer through this or just walk out now?i left with 20 minutes to go, in an imax cinema last night. they're just so painful to endure, it's really not worth anyones time.boycott all apple movies, they're destroying cinema.", "argylle is a newly released spy/thriller directed by matthew vaughn of kingsman fame. bryce dallas howard stars as the main protagonist ellie conway who is a fictionally acclaimed author of a series of spy novels. whilst trying to finish the final chapter of her fifth novel she is interrupted by sam rockwells character aidan, a stranger who informs her that the events portrayed in her books have actually taken place. as a result she must now work to finish the fifth book whilst being pursued by the 'the organisation' who are the villains of her own books in order to save her own life.this film has been largely panned by critics and for the first ninety minuets of its two hours and twenty minute run time i was unsure as to why. there seemed to be an interesting story building around this writer and what is and isn't the reality of the situation. i found the film to be most interesting in the brief time that ellie is unsure whether to trust aidan as that's where the tension really held up well.quite early on into the second half of the however i felt the film showed its cards too early. we quickly start to learn more about the reality of the situation and the more i found out the more that tension evaporated until quite quickly all that was left to be enjoyed about the film was the action sequences.the action sequences themselves are pretty much what you would expect from the director of kingsman. very stylised and over the top and yet with no blood as of course they had to get that pg-13 rating. the difference between this and kingsman though is that this film really goes balls to the wall with the action sequences, dare i say borderline fast and furious levels of bs at times. this took all the grittiness that makes action sequences enjoyable away and drew my attention towards the shoddy cgi work even more.one thing this film did do a good job of though was its marketing. clearly a lot of money was put into it as the trailer for this film was everywhere and if you've ever seen a film before in your life then i'm sure you've had it recommended to you somewhere online. the trailer and the poster for that matter make it look like henry cavill is the protagonist however that's very much not the case. he's completely wasted to be honest so avoid this one if he was one of the big selling points of this film for you.props to the marketing team for a great exercise in misleading cinema goers.overall i can't help but feel this was a concept with a lot of potential most of which was wasted by the end of the film. perhaps a different writer and director could have done a better job.", "we have been catfished!!! the actors i wanted to watch in this movie, all had minor roles. their screen time was less than 3 minutes. it was a shame! i would have loved to watch a movie with henry, dua and cena and of course other actors. instead this movie had none of them. i repeat none.the movie also felt too long. some of the scenes looked cheap. there were scenes that were just filmed in a house, or just some room with computers, (omg their monitors are transparent, there goes the budget). only 2 or 3 scenes of this movie were good action movie scenes.again i am mad that i was tricked by the trailer. i expected different actors to be the lead in this movie. and it would have been a lot better if dua lipa and henry and cena hadn't made such a big impression in those first scenes. it is truly a shame that the movie i thought i would see doesn't exist.", "if you are expecting to see a spy movie with john cena and henry cavill, you will be highly disappointed. cena was it the movie less than the mechanical shark was in jaws. cavill only slightly more. dua lipa? 5 min. the remainder of the movie is two and a half painful hours of reappearing characters that you thought were dead, and others you wish were dead. it must have been written during the writers strike because i think ai wrote most of it. i left when the credits rolled, and when the mid credit marvell-esque preview came on, i broke into a sprint, if one movie does not need added material it's this one,", "is it a great movie? not really. it's very good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun i've had watching a movie since...well, since the kingsmen funnily enough. another awesome matthew vaughn/marv picture. a couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - samuel l jackson playing a good guy, and sofia boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in the kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of henry cavill, bryce dallas howard, bryan cranston, catherine o'hara (who is always a goddess on screen), and of course sam rockwell.a word of warning, though. if you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the bonds, or the bourne franchise, or really any of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. however, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a lot of fun, with matthew vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. and oh my goodness did i have fun!?", "i won't beat around the bush when i'm discussing what didn't work in argylle but i would feel remiss if i also didn't credit what worked in this mixed bag of a movie. the first obvious positive is the cast, there's some serious wattage from their collective star power. starting with our lead bryce dallas howard, i think she did about as good of a job as could reasonably be expected. she's certainly done no favours by the script, her character's motivations and personality shift on a dime (sometimes from scene to scene). she does what she can in the action, she gets a few laughs as the smart yet dowdy ellie conway and she has some palpable chemistry with her primary co-star. henry cavill's is well cast as the stoic yet fully capable agent argylle. i like watching cavill in action movies period, he's got the physicality for the stunts/choreography and the talent to bring some personality to the characters he plays. he's appropriately suave here and it looks like he's having fun. i actually wish we had gotten even more time with this character. i want to tip my hat to bryan cranston and catherine o'hara respectively. they're both in roles which would have been easy to phone in, the angry spy chief and the supportive but out-of-touch mother. but bryan brought some intensity/gravitas as director ritter and catherine was funny even though her character is s cliche. as much as i really liked the entire cast, there was one performance that stood out among the rest. sam rockwell is a fantastic talent even on his worst day but he was awesome as aidan wilde. he has an effortless charm and a seemingly easy but deceptively sharp comic delivery that mesh so perfectly with his secret agent character. even when argylle was about to collapse, his shared chemistry with howard helped keep the movie above water. i'd love to offer further comments on samuel l. jackson and john cena as alfie and wyatt but they're in the movie so briefly, i feel like i can't grade them accurately. i did also want to congratulate dua lipa, she also doesn't have much screen time but she nailed the seductive and dangerous vibe of her character lagrange. i'd like to see her in a james bond-esque movie in a similar style of role, i was very impressed.the other clear standout aspect is matthew vaughn's filming style for the action scenes. he and his crew know how to bring a sense of danger (through the choreography and the editing) to punch up what could be rote. i did wish that argylle would have gone full kingsman and done it with an r rating but argylle still had it's moments even if it was a little more subdued. my favourite was the scene on the train but vaughn and his crew's fingerprints are all over all the action bits and they fit the bill for what the genre requires.i try to form my own opinions about the movies i watch, the critics can be right or wrong depending on the movie and the viewpoint. but i have to admit, when it comes to argylle's missteps, the group of them more or less nailed it. people have been quick to point the finger at matthew vaughn for argylle's messy plot and pacing (he should at least share the blame but he's not the sole offender) but i want to point out writer jason fuch's screenplay for fumbling the story repeatedly. argylle can't make up its mind on where to stop twisting the story, this might seem like nit-picking but watch the movie, i guarantee you'll be shocked at how many times plot twists feature. agent argylle seems like a real person part of the time but then in the next scene, he's a figment of ellie's imagination. there's some badly needed clarity to what is actually going on, especially later in the film. it was just shift after shift and while i normally like a good plot twist, by attempt #5 i was just groaning in my seat or quietly yet still saying wtf out loud. i think the plausibility goes out the window early and just never comes back and as much as argylle isn't supposed to be realistic, the creative team needs to put enough effort in so i don't disconnect from the movie completely. the long run time compounds this problem, you could have shaved about 30 minutes off this movie without losing anything relevant to the plot. the decision to keep so much in just adds to the movie's pacing problems and it made me yearn for matthew vaughn's better previous works. i also couldn't help but feel a little cheated as half of the cast that feature in the poster have so little to do in the movie that it almost felt like false advertising.i so badly wanted argylle to be good. i love some of vaughn's previous work (i adore the original kingsman and x-men: first class is my favourite x-men movie). but argylle is at best a mixed bag with some redeeming qualities that are outweighed by some baffling choices in the screenplay and an unfocused story. if you take matthew vaughn's flair out of the movie (the movie does have cool locales, costumes, set dressing and some good looking cgi), there's so little left here minus the cast. i'm going to have to reluctantly give argylle a 6/10 and i do feel like i could have graded it much more shrewdly. i still enjoyed argylle and i would recommend it if you enjoy spy movies and frenetic action but the overall appeal isn't going to transcend like vaughn's kingsman franchise. turn your brain off and keep expectations low, argylle may work for you better than first thought.", "i went in with an open mind, keeping my expectations very low all things considered. i really liked the premise of this film, and it could have had potential. but everything about the film is bad, and there is literally not one positive point i could tell you about it other than the good cgi (which is wayyyy overused.)there appears to be a complete miscasting issue with none of the cast performing convincingly. there were some big names here, they weren't in good form at all.and as for the plot, well what plot? there isn't really one here and everything just functions as one excuse to show off the cgi. it has the feeling of a cynical cash grab and it's such a shame as with the right guidance there could have been a good film here.i also saw a few people leaving the cinema, that's never a good sign.", "there is some very dumb writing at the beginning half hour of this film, but once you get past that the film loosens it's shackles and gives you a good time for the rest of its run time.the idea behind the film is brilliant, you could tell everyone was having fun when doing this film. the one big criticism i have is there is some god awful cgi where it just wasn't necessary. two characters spinning around in a circle? just cgi the background to spin around wildly instead of the actors actually spin around themselves! they somehow managed to make the actual real life cat look fake almost all the time, i don't know how that's possible.bryce dallas-howard still can't be anything other than herself, but sam rockwell smashes it out of the park again. the action sequences are fun but also hampered by the ugly visual effects mentioned previously.go into this movie with an open mind, but knowing you're probably gonna have some good fun with it. it's no casino royale, but it doesn't want to be.", "basically, a movie for middle aged cat ladies. cavill was in the trailer just so they would watch the movie. i knew he will be a cameo since i watched the trailer. it was so obvious that he will be 5 min. in the movie if you actually paid attention in the trailer that he is an imaginary character, same as the singer.only interest i had for this is to check is it everything i expect it would be and it is. some fine actors are wasted on this generic trash. there is nothing more to be said about this movie, i just have to keep going to fill in insane number of words for something so worthless in every way imaginable. also, early 2000s cgi because reasons.", "when i walked out of the theater after seeing this movie, i knew it wasn't for everyone, but wow! people are reaaaaaally upset about it. all of the feedback that i've seen on social media has been entirely negative. absolutely, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but it's really a lot of hate. i've even seen multiple popular youtubers claim it was the worst film they have ever seen.to people who share that view, i offer my opinion with utmost sincerity: if this is the \"worst movie you've ever seen\", maybe watch a few more movies. i promise, it'll build character.so what did i think? it was fun. it was campy. it was ridiculous and incredibly stupid. it had my boyfriend and i cackling at the ridiculous twists and unnecessary turns and insane dialogue nonstop. the actors all delivered entertaining performances that brought charm and humor to even the goofiest moments.yes, i think that the budget was wayyy too high. yes, i think that the writing was unnatural and the plot was contrived. yes, the cgi cat was weird. but this is nothing new for big budget movies, and it did not feel like an accident. honestly, i felt like i was watching an action/spy satire more than anything else.if you genuinely sat through those entire 2 hours and were convinced that the movie was taking itself seriously, i think that you are beyond my help. or anyone else's, for that matter. i mean, come on. by the third plot twist, how did you not catch on?in summary for the naysayers: check your ass for sticks, take a deep breath, and watch a few bad movies. have a lovely day.", "the first half of the movie was decent and then it just went downhill from there. the dance scenes were so cringy and not funny if thats what they were going for. the movie made no sense it was all over the place! i found myself very confused multiple times. a big waste of good actors! i could barley finish the last half hour because it became increasingly ridiculous. it almost made me feel like they were mocking spy movies. it's sad how bad movies are anymore. whoever wrote this one needs to stay away from making movies. i am just glad i didnt spend my money in the theater watching this mess of a movie!", "one thing id say going into this is that if you don't like daft, unrealistic comedy then this isn't the one for you. the whole movie set up is great and unique with plenty of twists in between. all characters to my opinion are used extremely well. action packed joy ride from start to finish with a lot of funny moments. this film has it all in relation to a spy/espionage movie, sam rockwell especially done a great job with his role and so did henry cavill and john cena for the limited time they had. main lead was a solid selection and filled the role of author turned spy extremely well. a solid 7/10 at best, certainly not perfect but it's not meant to be a serious watch. sit back and enjoy.", "tl:dr it's 'argyle', or 'argyll'. if you can't get that right, you won't get anything else right, and they didn't. it's like saying 'alabamma', or 'pariss'. or 'applle'. you've seen all of this before.interior: draughty-looking mosque-based nightclub. day.what's with his hair? has he been using miracle-gro instead of wash'n'go? he looks like a squeezed tube of black toothpaste. there are two kinds of people in this film: men trying to look like arnold schwarzenegger, even bryan cranston whose fame went to his head, and women who look like they've neglected to do their roots. apart from applle herself, who looks like taylor swift did fifteen years ago, without the curls, and without the talent.in every scene there are security guys/bouncers; presumably to keep the actors on the set, because nobody with any self-esteem would have stayed on set for thirty seconds.the script was written after the plastic action figures were designed.in fact, it was plastic action figures that wrote it.it's a sad fact that some 50-90% of movies made before 1950 are irretrievably lost. it's even sadder that 'applle' will never join them.", "what fun!great actors, over-the-top story, corny, silly, pretty-to-look-at adventure comedy that sometimes took me by surprise.i don't really have much else to add. this is just what i needed right now. life is hard and there's not much to smile about for me these days, but i was grinning much of the move and laughed out loud at times.i hope we can start embracing camp more.my main negative criticism is that i wish they didn't make the cat a scottish fold. i realize it was cgi, but given all the health issues and pain this breed has, i am not a fan of putting that breed more in the public eye.but other than that, i had such a good time and plan to rewatch.", "just saw the movie argyllle.loved it!both my husband and i.we laughed, we had a good time. thanks to the actors and everyone behind the scenes. we wanted to get out of the house. we saw some of the reviews therefore had low expectations. we were pleasantly surprised.relax. turn your brain off. go to a movie in february. it's cold and there's nothing else to do. go out with your spouse, you've been stuck in the house too long.what i'm trying to say (again) is this: it's a fun movie, full of surprising and unexpected twists and turns that actually make sense in this (twisted) world.it is rated pg here in mississauga, canada. a fair bit of swearing but only 1 f bomb. lots of over the top silly violence. really would not recommend it for the younger set. 11+ maybe, but then we are next to puritans.i want to see it a second time", "the movie is an affluent island of super pronounced, irrelevant visual effects, too much! plus, the plot is overdone, the scenes seem to look so d**b feeling like it was being directed by peasants who know who to manipulate knobs of visual effects control panel...dialogues are super cliched, jokes are really dull, even the scenes with the cat that often hit millions of views on youtube look horrible. why that weird bag, why that cat, why it starts acting so weird in the end of the movie... irrelevant.oh sure, one thing that can make some people like it is the cool scenes of the buffed guys, who also often appear as an ice cream... ice cream atop the ocean of sour low quality ketchup which will be eventually mixed together...aweful experience.", "i just came out from my second seeing argylle. first time not so many people, smaller cinema room. thought then, well, not for everyone's taste. now bigger room and, quite in the opposite to what one reads on other sites - full house. people of all ages, nationalities and gender in. astonishingly, almost all of them, even younger girls and boys, found something for themselves in that movie: 5-6 time scenes applause! people celebrated single scenes and applauded at the end, definitely not seeing it for the first time! whatever critics say, people love that movie! as do i. thanks a lot to all who brought this into existence. hope there will be more.", "if you've read the book don't expect a faithful adaptation. this is a movie for those who enjoy the world of the kingsmen. don't expect a henry cavill movie, he's not in the movie and awful lot it's a story about sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard's characters and switches between reality and fiction almost seamlessly a tale of walter mitty vs jason bourne if you will. it's an anti james bond movie that rattles along at a rare old pace even for a movie that clocks in at around 2 hours and 20 minutes. look i'm a little biased i did a week's work on the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the experience especially working with bryce dallas howard who was always giggling between takes. look this is a good movie, it's not a critics movie it's not going to win any oscars and with the inside knowledge that henry was also filming enola holmes and doing press for the witcher. it's quite an achievement. sa.", "this movie is like a horse painting meme. at some point in the middle i was really surprised with it being rated at 6 here, and at the end i wholeheartedly agreed.it starts really great and offers a nice intrigue, and then another one, and another one. but at some point the endless barrage of intrigues makes every next one boring, and at the same time there's a sudden switch in visual styling and tone. the movie turns into just another attempt to do an over-the-top spy action and the final act crumbles over its' own predictability.i liked it overall but it lacks focus and the decisiveness of making an initial concept into a movie."]}

performances involving members of the french resistance during world war ii. although i have not yet read the account on which it is based, i have no reason to believe the film takes too many liberties with the truth. the locations and sets seem very authentic, and the dialogue is evocative of the way people spoke at the time. something exceptional is presented by way of action sequences, in fact, where attempts at re-enacting simple events on film often fail; namely, the interdiction of a convoy carrying prisoners and a particularly realistic execution scene. high marks are due the production crew for this one. the overall history of the french resistance is an extremely complicated tale to be retold for purposes of explaining just how this story resonates. young viewers need to educate themselves in that history in order to appreciate fully this film's merits.", "this film is an excellent tribute to the bravery of the men and women of the french resistance during the second world war. the film revolves around lucie and her attempts to rescue her husband, after he is arrested by the gestapo at a resistance meeting. this film is indeed a testimony to lucie and raymond's relationship, but in my mind, the film serves equally as an insight into france during the occupation and the political state at the time. an excellent film. - jonno", "i love french movies what can i say. this one is really good as well. interesting story i'd never really thought about. i was worried it would be old and bad you know like many period films are but this one is pretty well done. the acting is up to scratch and especially moments when the captives are in the prison and they really are feeling the pain and torture and still managing to resist the urge to stop it. very few weaknesses as well. lucie is really beautiful as well a pleasure to watch. very desparate film which is well resolved. overall worth a watch. i gave it 8.", "first-rate acting and smooth direction make this personal recounting of controversial resistance events well worth seeing. as with all films by claude berri, the storytelling is direct and the cinematography is both poignant and sensitive. daniel auteuil is great as usual. carole bouquet also contributes, albeit with less emotional range. the movie focuses as much on the love between lucie and raymond aubrac as on the historical events surrounding them as they participate in the french resistance to german occupation during world war ii. the movie also contains powerful action scenes of escape and guerilla fighting (which the germans considered terrorism at the time). watch for a striking scene where heino ferch (as klaus barbie) tortures auteuil (as lucie's husband raymond) to obtain information about resistance leader \"max\". not only is this scene memorably acted and filmed, but it bears on a most controversial event in the history of the resistance. the script follows a book by lucie aubrac that is ostensibly autobiographic. to this day, historians debate whether the aubracs remained committed to the resistance or whether raymond actually cracked under torture and betrayed resistance mastermind jean moulin (\"max\"). moulin was arrested soon after raymond left prison and died a hero, refusing to speak under the torture of klaus barbie, the \"butcher of lyons\". these events and barbie's much later in persona trial (1987) still rattle many people's understanding of the morals and history of france in the last sixty-plus years.", "lucy aubrac (carole bouquet) is a woman in love with her husband raymond (daniel auteuil). he is an important member of the french resistance and arrested with his friends in a meeting after being betrayed. lucy will try to rescue him from the gestapo prison using all the possible ways. a beautiful romance in the second world war, based on a true story. a correct direction and good performances of the cast make this movie a worthwhile entertainment. my vote is seven.", "\"lucie aubrac\" tells a slightly tweaked version of the true story of one woman's heroic struggle as a member of the underground resistance in wwii occupied france. though artistically and technically excellent, many will find this story only marginally interesting as it lacks the usual suspense, action, and other excesses which the public, especially the young theater-going audiences, expect of such films. nonetheless, just watching two fine french actors (bouquet & auteuil) at work telling a story not oft told in film will be sufficient for many, especially those into europics who don't mind subtitles.", "while not on a par with berri's remarkable 2 film epic \"jean de florette\" and manon of the spring\", this is a fairly engrossing, romantic, if somewhat romanticized true story of a married pair of resistance fighters in wwii france. both daniel auteil and carole bouquet are solid as the couple, especially in their scenes together, which nicely capture the erotic tension of a married couple deeply in love, whose passion is not just physical, but fed by the fact they admire each other as human beings as well. it's also nice to see a war film where the woman pulls off the heroics to try and save her man, rather than the other way around. but the darkness of occupied france seems a but sanitized here, the awful price paid by those fighting back and their innocent families is alluded too but never fully dealt with, and there is something a bit light weight about it in the end. bouquet keeps everything so hidden when not around autiel that she becomes somewhat opaque. it's always interesting, but a bit stolid. rarely truly tense, frightening or emotional. still it's a good, decent, involving film, if not a great one.", "claude berri commented that his film was primarily a study of lucie and raymond's relationship irrespective of the political events going on around them. to me this was the central weakness of the film. it seemed to be more an examination of 1990s french attitudes towards masculinity than an exploration of two people's love for each other amidst a major conflict. the courage and bravery of people in wartime is treated as being of secondary importance to the love affair.", "when 'lucie aubrac', claude berri's 1997 film, was made, the story of resistance and love at the heart of the film was already more than half a century old history, but its main characters were still alive. lucie and raymond aubrac, communist fighters in the anti-nazi resistance, had survived the war and become national heroes for most of the french, but also controversial figures for some. they had been involved in the fall of an important part of the leadership of the resistance, led by jean moulin, probably due to a betrayal that even to this day has not been fully elucidated. the script of the film 'lucie aubrac' is based on the memoirs of the heroine who gives the title of the film and presents the point of view of the aubracs, dressing the episode of arrest and betrayal in a romantic love story. it could be that the historical part and the love story are both true. but illustrating a personal version of history in a controversial case is not the best starting material for a film that has ambitions of authenticity. it is probably one of the reasons why 'lucie aubrac' fails to convince to the end and the film does not live up to its promises. luminous, unblemished characters are not ideal material for a film about a controversial case in troubled and dark times.raymond and lucie aubrac had met and married just before the outbreak of world war ii. raymond was a civil engineer and an officer in the french army, a leader of the resistance, a politician and an activist after the war - quite an interesting personality, but this is not visible much on screen, the film rather assigning him the role of the husband repeatedly rescued from detentions by the devoted wife. at the center of the story is placed the character of lucie, with her struggles to free her husband, through ruse, threats and armed actions. the couple was heavily involved in the resistance struggle and raymond had been one of the eight heads of the organization arrested in lyon in 1943. the woman's passion and devotion will overcome all obstacles. they also dominate the film.the historical reconstruction is very well done - the setting, clothing, cars, trams and the characters' way of speaking. detention and brutal interrogations are shown without avoiding details. the role of raymond is played by daniel auteuil, an actor i really like. here he makes the most of the script, but the historical personality of the man would have allowed, i think, a more complex representation. because of the script, the role of lucie aubrac becomes key. carole bouquet physically meets the requirements, she is excellently dressed and all the stills look very good. on the screen, however, something is missing - the charm that would make the love story believable and the magnetism that would convince us that the heroine could really pull the strings with the occupation police chiefs and organize the armed actions that freed raymond. the role was originally to be played by juliette binoche, who dropped out of filming after two weeks due to 'artistic differences' with claude berri. how 'lucie aubrac' would have looked and how it would have been appreciated with juliette binoche instead of carole bouquet is an exercise in imagination and a chapter in an alternative history of cinema.", "this is a rather small and quiet wwii film. while the film excels at its realistic portrayal of the french resistance, it is a film that would be \"box office poison\" in america because its commercial marketability is pretty limited. this is not a film that teens or many prospective viewers would rush to the theaters to see! there are few explosions and the nudity isn't the least bit gratuitous. because of this, it would only have been made abroad or by an independent film maker and so it wasn't surprising that this film was shown on the sundance channel.the story purports to be about a real couple who worked for the resistance movement. when the husband (daniel auteuil) is taken by the nazis, his devoted wife (carole bouquet) tries desperately to free him. both actors are pretty recognizable to american audiences, as auteuil has appeared in tons of films--playing a sort of \"everyman\" character and bouquet played the female lead in one of the bond films (for your eyes only), though she's done plenty of films as well. for a 40 year-old lady, bouquet is amazingly beautiful and sensuous--way to go, girl! the action is very low-key but tense and the film is a very enjoyable history lesson designed for an adult and discriminating audience.", "this movie is a disgrace to all of those who worked hard to make a movie on the resistance.the characters poorly elaborates, not evolving, disapointing dialogues, good actors who are not convincing at all (auteuil is deceiving, compared to les surdoués or manon des sources where he was glorious) we barely believe a second any scene. sometimes it even felt like a parody. we just on laughing at the stupidity of certain passage. in the end, we didn't feel strong emotions, no thrill not even sympathy for the main character.in the end no emotions felt, we were left hanging dry. complete disgrace..", "claude berri began filming this movie in 1996 with daniel auteuiland juliette binoche. berri and the headstrong binoche came to(creative) blows over script changes. he wanted to make it more ofa love story, she wanted it to remain more factual and so in a moveunheard of in french cinema he fired his leading actress, whoalso happened to be the biggest french star in the world. a fewmonthe later she won an oscar for the english patient and berrirecast his movie with carole bouquet in the lead.bouquet is a talented actress, but not in the same league as theextremely gifted binoche. auteuil as usual gives a fineperformance, but the whole excersise seems leaden down byromanticism. binoche and auteuil went on to star together in leconte'saltogether better la veuve de saint-pierre", "it's always problematical when a given actor/actress is replaced during filming for whatever reason. personally i thought ray walston was fantastic in 'kiss me, stupid' and can't visualize peter sellars even equalling walston's performance, let alone eclipsing it. so it is here. one commentator bizarrely described juliet binoche as the best actress in france. i have every admiration for binoche and see as many of her films as possible but has the commentator in question never heard of isabelle huppert, nathalie baye, suzanne flon, sandrine kiberlain, manu beart, etc. nevertheless this is still a great movie and i for one cannot imagine anyone other than carole bouquet as the eponymous heroine. were this fiction it may be thought a tad over the romantic top to have two lovers celebrate the date they first made love and take a vow to be together on that particular anniversary for as long as they live, but, as we know, this is a true story and both lovers, auteuil and bouquet make it believable. there is a certain symmetry here too if anybody asks you. having established under the credits an active resistance group in which auteuil (as francois samuel, 'aubrac' was the resistance name of the husband and wife team)is prominent we then see him at home in a tender scene with his wife (bouquet) which establishes the secondary (or primary, depending on your point of view) theme of enduring love, and then, to put things in perspective, we see lucie in her day job of schoolteacher, spelling out to les enfants the value of history as a learning tool and reminding them that even as they speak they are themselves living history. we are then into a somewhat conventional resistance story. brave freedom fighters captured and tortured, one woman's love overcoming the might of the occupying forces. it is interesting that berri has opted to show lyon as a sun-filled city - perhaps a hangover from his jean de florette/manon des sources gig a dozen years earlier - and this not only makes a contrast from the usual bleak, overcast, settings of other resistance movies, but also points up the horror/barbarism occurring behind closed shutters while the sun pours down on france's second city. of course any film on the resistance has to compete with 'l'armee des ombres' and, to a lesser extent, 'laissez passer' and if lucie doesn't quite make it she makes a very creditable and honorable attempt. 8/10", "a prominent figure of the french resistance,lucie aubrac was very popular in france.till her death ,she visited the junior high schools,explaining those dark years to the pupils,answering their questions .she even wrote a small book \"la resistance expliquée a mes enfants\" the relevance of which was obvious:she pointed out the important role of women in the resistance when she wrote :\"it's sometimes more dangerous to visit prisoners or to carry documents on your rack than to blow up a train.\" carole bouquet and daniel auteuil did a good job ,but claude berri didn't really.his movie is mtv quality and it boils down to a woman trying to save her husband and it passes over in silence the stakes in resistance.we do not really learn anything.take melville's \"l'armée des ombres\"(1969) instead."]}

however, this character doesn't fit the role of a heroic lead, much less a sympathetic protagonist. one view is that the protagonist is the character with whom the audience identifies and wants to see succeed. but harriet is a self-centered, conniving, self-indulgent sociopath and isn't very likeable, so it's difficult to identify with her character or to care whether she succeeds or gets her comeuppances. she's not an antihero, simply a lousy protagonist. another view is that the protagonist is the character who must change the most, acquire new skills and knowledge and forge new alliances in order to overcome a seemingly unsurmountable obstacle. but this is a point-a-to-point-a story, like u-turn and after hours, where the characters have a series of misadventures, but wind up pretty much back where they started. the movie lacks a consistent dramatic perspective. flashbacks can be a very effective technique, particularly in detective stories, to visualize the possibly conflicting accounts of potentially unreliable witnesses, as in rashomon or lone star. otherwise, flashbacks and dream sequences should be limited to one character. tim roth's peter is good as a cynical, sardonic sidekick, but is practically catatonic in most scenes from drugs and alcohol. stephen fry's sidney is irredeemably corrupt - one of those characters you love to hate. alice eve, maggie q, sofia vergara and uma thurman have each played beautiful, seductive characters in the past, but despite various subplots centered around unbridled passion, infidelity and unrequited love, tcio is not very sexy. the con involves exploiting mistaken identities and deception, but no confidence game. the characters cook up a plot that isn't particularly devious or ingenious. the pace is ponderous. despite a relatively brief ninety-minute length, it seems to drag.", "i cannot believe that somebody (or somebodies) allowed the making of this for 13,000,000. they would have been better off to go out into the woods with the money and burn it. there's not a single likable character in the whole film. all of them are what i call \"darwin award\" winners (for service to humanity by removing themselves from it). unfortunately, none of the main characters gets killed. they just go on with their idiotic behaviour. is this what the \"film\" makers are trying to say: that the world is just full of alcoholic, gambling addicted thieves and killers, and we have to get used to it to survive? even the catholic church? in short, neither clever nor funny (okay, one genuinely funny scene with the ring - but highly improbable). and it took 5 (!) production companies to get this mess made. maybe that's what it was - an elephant designed by a committee that came out an aardvark (with apologies to aardvarks). too bad there aren't negative ratings here. i expect this to win all sorts of razzies from wherever they give them out.", "you won't see a worse movie than this. no surprise it took 3 years to get released.what i wonder is, how does something like this work? it is inconceivable there could be any good reviews or word of mouth recommendations. does it aim to get its production costs back purely through product placement?incidentally.....i gave 2 stars solely because i've read that 1 star reviews don't get counted. it should really be 0 stars.", "this is not a good movie to see if you have a drug or alcohol problem. tim roth is chugging vodka in too many scenes, and various people pop pills or cut cocaine as their need arises. gambling and theft is a way of life and many icons are smashed. i laughed out loud a few times. some scenes shot at chateau marmont where john belushi snorted his last snort.anti hollywood and movie star madness of any generation. if you are in the industry, forget it. has very cute dog who was the real star!", "no spoilers here!!!this movie is an absolute pos...tim roth's dreadful cockney london accent will drive you mental as his lines are pretty much \"fahking 'ell\" or \"fahk this\". the story is predictable, pedestrian and subsequently, utterly boring. it looks like it was shot on a very tight budget but trying to look like a jetsetting blockbuster because i noticed that at one point, when they were supposed to be in america, you can see the cars on the road behind them driving on the left...rubbish attention to detail. the acting was cringeworthy in the extreme. a very poor attempt at an old english style \"ealing comedy\" executed disastrously. trust me 3.5 is a generous rating for such utter rubbish", "there's a great script here struggling to get out. alas, it fails to even open the door.writer/director! when will producers learn!? i'm guessing never so we continue to be plagued by these half-a**ed screenplays that desperately need a 2nd or 3rd eye to curb the writer's sense of brilliance! (that's irony for our american friends.)let's start with the title. it's not a movie about a con. jesus! c'mon guys, at least get the terminology right. it's more a sort of comedy caper/heist movie, but it's not even that.the worst character by far is tim roth's peter. no doubt roth enjoyed playing him although it would be as challenging as waking up in the morning. he's so lacking in couth it's absolutely impossible to imagine he could ever have gotten involved with alice eve or uma thurman, zany and cracked though their characters may be.maggie q must have had a similar challenge with her character.highlight of the movie is stephen fry playing, well, stephen fry's \"dear boy\" character, but he does it so naturally and so well. although not a major character he does help redeem it from the pit.it's not totally unwatchable. well, if you're looking for a good plot or well-defined characters or well, anything, then it is...okay, it has good production values and a stellar cast but they're simply wasted, wasted, wasted.i didn't think it was quite as bad as other reviews suggest which i find hard to believe! but it is extremely disappointing.", "difficult to follow and to pay attention when watching.", "what even was this?

to watch, but it is well worth the discomfiting experience. not quite enough attention has been paid to the plight of mental health patients who try to re-integrate into the community, and certainly too little attention has been placed on the frustration and even exasperation of their caregivers. while the former often find their best attempts thwarted by the fears, biases and outright discrimination of general society, the latter has to contend not only with the same but also the outbursts of their loved ones struggling to overcome their condition, so much so that many often end up in burnout.both perspectives are vividly portrayed in director paul chun's feature debut, which follows tung's (shawn yue) acclimatisation to the outside world after spending a year in a mental hospital for bipolar disorder. seeing little more that institutionalisation can do for tung, the hospital contacts his estranged father wong (eric tsang) to look after him, but the latter is frankly completely ill- prepared. a cross- border truck driver who was often absent from home, wong had pretty much abandoned his mentally disturbed wife (elaine jin) and tung years ago, which tung inevitably still begrudges him for; after all, that had led to tung needing to quit his job to take care of her when she became bedridden, and that stress of being the only caregiver, aggravated by her verbally abusive ways, had ultimately led to her accidental death one day and his subsequent admission into psychiatric care.there is plenty in the past that tung needs to come to terms with on his own, and equally just as much in the present. his friends had deserted him ever since the much-publicised incident a year earlier, and his surprise appearance at a former colleague's wedding soon after his discharge shows how ignorant and bigoted they can be. he wants to make things right with his former fiancée jenny (charmaine fong), who had to repay not just the flat they had bought together but also the moneylenders tung owed because of a huge loan he took out to finance some risky investments that eventually went south. it doesn't help that social media has fuelled a gallery of judgmental jury, who seize on his unfortunately public meltdown after hearing jenny's emotive confession of her ordeal to question his mental state and weigh if he should be sent back to hospital after all.oh yes, the title could refer to tung's own mind as much as it could of the external environment he has to navigate – and wong takes swipes at everything from our prejudice against the mentally ill, to the terrible living conditions of hong kong's lower-class, and even to the spate of 'banker' suicides in the financial district back in 2014/15. it is to his credit as well as that of screenwriter florence chan that their movie never feels the need to scream at or, for the lack of a better word, get mad at these social ills; rather, both display remarkable restraint at simply keeping it authentic, letting their audience make their own discernments rather than lay out the critique for us.in fact, 'mad world' is much better off by simply remaining at its heart a frank and intimate portrait of tung's struggle to get back on his feet, anchored by the initially tense but ultimately tender father-son relationship between tung and wong. like we said at the beginning, the struggle is as much tung's as it is wong's. through the course of the movie, wong has to seriously evaluate if he has the means and wherewithal to care for tung, especially given how little support he has from his family (his eldest son, or tung's older brother, has resettled in the united states, staying conspicuously absent and callously disengaged throughout), friends and fellow tenants – and let's just say it says a lot when another caregiver at a carer support programme wong enrols himself in advises him to consider re-admitting tung back into hospital under the false pretence that the latter is suicidal.though more commonly known for his comedic roles, eric tsang is in top form here as wong. in perfectly low-key fashion, tsang lays bare his character's uncertainties and anxieties at the beginning when asked to look after tung, subsequent guilt and pain when forced to confront the sins of his past, and eventually resolve to not 'outsource' his responsibilities as a father. tsang doesn't overplay or overstate wong's dilemmas, allowing his audience to make sense of his character on their own terms. for that matter, so does yue, who eschews histrionics in his portrayal of tung's manic/ depressive state. proving his mettle as one of the most underrated actors of his generation, yue gives a layered, nuanced performance that earns empathy without ever playing the 'pity' card. aside from the fact that tung's journey to reintegrate back into the community is not an easy one, 'mad world' is also not an easy fact simply because there are no easy solutions to the issues faced by people like tung. at the individual level, it isn't easy for the caregiver, as wong's own experience here shows. at the community level, it isn't easy for neighbours, friends and even relatives to put aside their fears or biases. and at the societal level, it isn't easy to change mindsets borne out of ignorance or worse convenience. but like the quote which bookends the movie, it starts with having a heart for these individuals we often shun, so that however idealistic it may sound, the world may be a little less crazy for them and for us.", "there have been few note-worthy films coming out of hong kong for some time. it does seem that every other output from the studios is a commercial film that tries hard to appeal to the gargantuan china market. in this sense, debut director wong chun's mad world is an audacious and brave film.the subject matter is mental illness and it is remarkable that the film never stoops down low to gain your sympathy through cheap histrionics. the film earns it through superlative performances and keen observations. it not only gets inside the mind space of a mental illness patient, it also studies the plight of the care-giver and the bystanders standing in the path of the malady. neither does the film shout slogans, point fingers or offer pet solutions. mad world is an indictment on the social stigma and medical agencies, but how it remains deeply humanist is a deft balancing act.shawn yue puts in a career-defining performance as tung, a bipolar disorder sufferer. his range is commendable and his portrayal totally surprised me. he can start taking on more challenging roles, other than rebellious hunks and rigid police officers. there is a scene of him crying late into the night, every last bit of moisture inside him is pushing out of his eyes and yet he just can't stop. when finally he did stop crying, it is because a precocious little boy who lives next door is whispering a story from antoine de saint-exupéry's the little prince through the thin wall to encourage him. that scene moved me, i doubt tung can hear the story clearly, but i think at that point he needed to hear a voice from an understanding person.eric tsang as a guilt-ridden father trying to make amends is such a natural. my tears rolled down at a heart rending scene where he explains why he left his family. the reason doesn't make it right, but it is perfectly understandable why he did it. as tung's illness takes a turn for the worst, his soul becomes a constant battlefield – do i do the right thing or do i do the loving thing?jin as tung's embattled mother and fong as the ex-fiancée struggling to forgive tung are also pitch-perfect. all four, including screenwriter florence chan and the director have been showered with nominations at last year's golden horse film festival and hong kong film awards, and some of them have deservedly racked up the accolades.where mad world perhaps over-played its hand will be the scenes of the church portrayed as over-enthusiastic zealots and tung's friend louis having a turn for the worst at one point. the film felt like it was over-reaching. but i am not taking anything away from the film. this is a compassionate look at mental illness and it looks at the issue from all the angles. i would hardly call it an entertaining film, more of an affective and effective thought provoking piece of filmmaking. give me thought provoking anytime.", "this film tells the story of a young man whose life is in havoc because of bipolar disorder. he painfully finds out that he loses his job, his fiancée, his friends and his dignity after a one year stay in a mental hospital.i have to say i am very impressed by \"mad world\". first of all, it is rare for a hong kong film to have a non mainstream topic. the topic is so non mainstream that it is almost a taboo. i applaud the filmmakers for making this film, exposing the pain of people recovering from mental illness and their relatives too. one person's pain is transmitted to the families because of societal ignorance, intolerance and discrimination. some painful moments are done in an almost comedic manner, such as people taking photos of tung in the banquet, which lighten up the mood but also provokes the debate whether it is right or wrong to act like they did.secondly, acting is great. i never knew eric tsang is so good at portraying emotional roles, as i have previously seen him mostly in comedic roles. another strength of this film is that the plot is realistic, depressing and very touching. the plot is so strong that i think it is hard for people not to be moved. furthermore, the production quality is actually good, especially the cinematography which is unusually good. it enhances the mood and suspense, such as the scene of water going down the drain.i enjoyed watching \"mad world\". i hope more people will watch it, making the society understand the immense agony that people recovering from mental illness and their families go through.", "a film that reflects reality. even though the treatment of mental disorders has improved significantly, they still face their own past and social exclusion. if they can not get out, they will inevitably be forced back to the corner. in the first two-thirds of the movie, the perspective is limited to father and son. when the relationship between father and son improves, the former fiancee suddenly throws the protagonist back to hell, and the neighbor's exclusion brings the tone of the whole movie back to the tragedy of realism. this arrangement undoubtedly highlights the conflict of the drama, but the contrast is too large, which actually harms the plot.", "whilst perusing netflix to find an asian drama, mad world popped up in my recommendations. considering mental illness is still rather hush-hush in the east, i didn't have high hopes that mad world would cover the topic with subtly and honesty. color me surprised; after spending the last hour and 41 minutes with my eyes glued to the screen, i realized that not only is this one of the best portrayals of mental illness (bipolar disorder, specifically) i've ever seen put to film, but mad world now competes for the best movie i've watched yet this year. how this film isn't more well-known and awarded flabbergasts me.mad world follows the broken perspective of tung, a man suffering from bipolar disorder in hong kong who is released from a mental institution and forced to integrate once more into society and the shattered life he's left behind. we aren't clued in to all the details of tung's life and unhappiness right away; we know he's depressed, missing his fiancee, and that he has a strained relationship with the father he comes to live with. further details are lovingly sprinkled throughout the film in heart-wrenching flashbacks with perfect timing; never was i confused about the order of events or the impact they had on tung's psyche. i come from a family plagued with mental illness; bipolar disorder affected both my mother and brother, and contributed to the far too early demise of my brother just last month. the manic/depressive phases of this horrific illness are both laid out here in all their painful, raw glory; the highs are sky-high, and the lows are in the pits of depressive purgatory. it isn't just tung who suffers; his mother clearly has mental difficulties as well, and the other brother and father have their own realistic ways of dealing with it.the performances here are all stellar. tung's blank stares of utter hopelessness perfectly mimic those i have seen (and given) time and again when dealing with similar illnesses in my own life. tung's father's helplessness comes through in many scenes, and his well-meaning but misguided attempts to soothe his adult son are all too realistic to what many of us suffering from depression hear: \"why can't you just be normal?\" and \"why are you like this?\" and \"can't you try to be cheerful?\" the judgements of others play a large role here as well: tung's fiancee accidentally makes a tense situation worse in a pivotal scene, while leering bystanders see mental illness as a spectacle to jeer.mad world is not a \"fun\" movie to watch, nor is it heartfelt in the way that most would hope, with everything being fixed at the end and tied up nicely with a neat little bow. parts of it angered me. depressed me. saddened me. but most of all, as someone who has dealt with this personally, it made me feel like i am not alone. mad world does not sugarcoat the ugly parts of mental illness, whether they are born out of the ill or those who try to support them. it is for this reason that i found it an absolute and ironic breath of fresh air, for it is depressingly beautiful in its candor.some last minute thoughts: the camerawork was particularly interesting here, aiding the film's dreary atmosphere. for one example, it utilized long shots of the small apartment to make you confront its claustrophobic and cramped nature. the music was perfect: it fit the mood and was used sparingly. the movie felt a bit longer than its runtime, but since every minute was engrossing, i can't fault it for that. lastly, the characters don't grow much--if at all--during the movie. while this normally would be a flaw, it makes sense for a film about mental illness. sometimes those affected cannot strive for higher goals--sometimes they just need to learn how to *deal* to make it through the day and get to tomorrow alive. mad world isn't a film about a man's journey to overcome his mental illness; it's more of a day-in-the-life, where we experience what he goes through for a short time and can only hope for the best for him by the time the credits roll.mad world is a beautiful film that i recommend to anyone with mental illness, who knows someone with mental illness, or is open-minded enough to try to understand what living with it is like. make sure you're in the mood to watch it, however, as it's so effective at what it does it might make you feel worse.", "the director is young and new, yet he manages to portray the details of depression and illision to the full in the movie. at his age, he should not have such deep understanding. he must do a lot of resaerch on the topic. the story not just show what is psychiatric illness, but the living condition of hk people, working life of white collars and problem in psychiatry service...... extremely rich in content, i can hardly get a breath throughout the every moment of the film. the brilliance of the movie is demonstrated when compare to other movie of the same theme. beautiful mind, it is ok that is love, kmhm, kdrama. in these stories, the sick male leads are either genius, handsome, meeting good doctors, recover well. no miracle is found in mad world. it is a realistic movie portraying everyday life of a mental patient. it is not entertaining. you will feel blue after seeing it. so, a brillant movie can just earn a score of 7. and it fail to go into last round of oscar.the acting of leads are ok. i have no particular complaint, except the father. tsang is too experienced an actor. you always aware that he is acting a role. overacting i would say.i also feel unfair for the movie to show the government psychiatry as cool and robot like doctor. it is a great discouragement to those doctors truely concern patients.the scene i remember most is in the christian church gathering. average men are too ignorant of mental illness patient. they think they are helping, but actually are worsening the illness of patient. public education on society should be strengthened so that patient could better fit into the society.the director is a potential

though much of the acclaim i've read by online critics is the realism with which mental illness is treated, it heaps some of the most alienating societal abuses of the mentally ill on one person for full effect, short of failure of the justice sytem. is that realism? perhaps not, but it has a powerful political/moral point. the result of this is an almost over sweet tearjerker, but i honestly can not decide whether i am amazed that one movie revealed a seemingly unending store of emotion in me, or whether i am disappointed by chor hang chan's reliance on that catharsis. i would go with the former. outside of borderline cloying revelations, there are some dark and unforgiving moments, and some genuinely humorous ones, acknowledging that redemption is not the only frame for the issue at hand. the performance by shawn yue is well in character, drab and passionate at the right moments. and chun wong can definitely be relied upon as a director. and if you watch it for nothing else, the kid is incredibly adorable.", "it is a mad world ... and for some it is even madder. some people seem not to be able to catch a break. this movie is about outsiders who have issues to stay sane. and

will love the reality of it all, the gravitas the movie bathes in.again you may feel this isn't something worth watching and that is ok. if you'd rather watch something that is quite far away from

brings a unique perspective to his films, and this omnibus 2005 film exemplifies his idiosyncratic style quite well. even though it doesn't work in its entirety, it has a great ensemble cast and some really sharp observations about a loosely connected group of people who have in common a certain disassociation with the inner truths in their lives. in fact, the deceptive nature of the characters is the movie's leitmotif, and roos crosscuts their interactions with helpful title cards that often explain their inner motivations for their actions.there are three basic stories that constitute the film, which recalls the multi-layered, somewhat enervated spirit of robert altman's \"short cuts\" especially given the la-based ennui both films portray with accuracy. the first story deals with step-siblings mamie, who as a teenager, had a one-night stand with her stepbrother charley. years later, mamie is an abortion clinic worker, while charley, gay and partnered contently with gil for five years, runs their long-dead parents' last remaining restaurant. both siblings have their own storyline - mamie meets nicky, a grungy filmmaker who wants her to participate in a film about meeting someone from her past. however, she convinces nicky to make another film entirely about her intermittent lover javier's massage practice.the second story revolves around charley's obsession with the paternity of a son which their lesbian best friends have just conceived. this leads to unexpected revelations that backfire on charley. the third story focuses on otis, a closeted teenage drummer who works at charley's restaurant. otis meets jude, a vagabond singer who favors billy joel ballads and beds otis in order to have a place to crash. once established in the palatial home, she also attaches herself to otis's divorced father frank. it all sounds complicated and sometimes feels quite erratic, but roos makes the film intriguing to watch.the acting certainly helps. as mamie, lisa kudrow again shows how she can use her somewhat flaky persona in an arresting way that can be funny and heartbreaking. steve coogan effectively brings out charley's neuroses, while jesse bradford is convincingly suspect as nicky. the underutilized laura dern doesn't really have much to do as one-half of the lesbian couple (sarah clarke is the other half), while bobby cannavale gamely brings out the swarthy gamesmanship of javier. jason ritter (the look-alike son of the late john ritter) plays otis with the right amount of confusion and anxiety. as the bonhomous jude, maggie gyllenhaal (jake's sister) gives a shrewd performance that never borders on the obvious, while tom arnold surprises with a subtle turn as the comparatively innocent frank.the dvd has an alternate commentary track with roos, kudrow and cinematographer clark mathis, as well as ten deleted scenes of varying quality and three scenes that constitute the lacking gag reel. during the final film's lengthy 128-minute running time, there are scenes that seem to drift with no reason and character motivations that go unexplained. regardless, the film is definitely worth seeing.", "this is worth renting. not a classic but a distinct original with many commendable performances by a large cast of recognizable talent.now, keep in mind that this is a rambling soap opera crammed into roughly two hours. in order to keep pace, you'll need the following plan. first, get a nice cappuccino. get your bathroom breaks out of the way, and put your phone on silent ring and maybe discourage visitors because if you blink or walk away from this for even a moment, you will miss something and it will be tantamount to the story.this is very original though not too stylish. i don't know if everyone comes from this feeling better about the human condition or having enjoyed their time spent watching it but you need to be aware that this is an exercise in listening and paying attention, which will challenge many. if you fall into the category of \"many,\" maybe this isn't for you.if you like entertainment that takes you away from the formulaic layout and typical dialogue that you can see coming, this will not disappoint.enjoy and may you all have happy endings of your own-whatever they may be.", "don roos wrote and directed this lively, sometimes poignant, but not especially funny comedy-drama centering around an abortion counselor's secret that she had given birth to her step-brother's baby when she was a teenager and quickly gave it up for adoption. in this role, lisa kudrow really excels with the writer-director's dryly observant style: she's loose but not flailing, inquisitive but not harping, apprehensive but not frightened. kudrow (whose comic timing reminds one of roseanne's in the early years of her tv sitcom) mixes a look of anxiety, despair, nervousness and anticipation with astonishing skill--even when her character is humiliated (or humiliates herself), kudrow has a way of keeping all the flightiness grounded in some form of reality. matching her, maggie gyllenhaal and tom arnold have some wonderful early scenes; she's a born user and a killer karaoke singer, while he plays the father of the gay 21-year-old drummer whom gyllenhaal has already seduced and discarded. it's too bad we don't get more of this relationship, and also unfortunate that roos covers up most of their dialogue with soundtrack music (it's a coupling which happens in montage). roos plants little subtitles throughout the movie to help sort out who's-who, and this works to some degree (yet it's a relief when the device is momentarily given a rest). some of the other story threads are dim (a couple of which center on gay men turning their homosexuality on and off like a light-switch), but kudrow's work and tom arnold's natural, easy-going presence keep the film absorbing and often appealing. and nobody sings \"just the way you are\" like gyllenhaal. **1/2 from ****", "vignettes are a tricky business. to make a film with more than three main stories to follow that interconnect and are unified in some significant way is a challenge. \"love, actually\" is one of the only recent films to successfully pull this off, using christmas and love as a unifying factor. don roos' \"happy endings\" uses ... love? happiness? sexuality? infatuation? it's not clear, and making all the vignettes cross-connect with each other doesn't satisfy what we look for in these movies. each vignette should essentially tell the same message in a different way. \"happy endings\" has several original concepts, but the connection is obscure and hard to draw.roos (\"the opposite of sex\") essentially tells three stories: first follows mamie (lisa kudrow) and the documentary she helps aspiring filmmaker nicky (jesse bradford) make about her masseuse/lover javier (bobby cannavale) so that she can find out information nicky has of the son she gave away at birth when she was 18. the second follows the father of that child, charlie (steve coogan), who is now gay and convinced that his partner (david sutcliffe) is the biological father of their lesbian friends' son, whom he donated sperm to once and it supposedly didn't work. last is jude (maggie gyllenhaal), a free spirit who meets otis (jason ritter), a young man that works in charlie's restaurant who is hiding his homosexuality from his rich father (tom arnold). jude promises otis that she won't say anything if he doesn't spoil her plan to become involved with his father for the money.that mostly covers the labyrinthian complexity of \"happy endings,\" which despite it's courage to choose such unique scenarios , doesn't seem to ever make clear sense. it's all quite interesting, as this is relationship drama we've never seen before, but there are a lot of emotions flying around and motivations that seem to lack sources. it probably all made sense in roos' head, but it doesn't convert.the acting talent isn't necessarily lacking either. this is the best performance i've ever seen kudrow give in a film -- she reminds me of another annette bening. gyllenhaal is also one of the more complex (in the intriguing way) characters and she draws the widest variety of emotions from the audience as she crosses a fine line between sincerity and deception. although the characters are interesting, however, we mostly feel just apathy because the snippets we get of them are more puzzling than revealing.another unique technique that roos employs is adding subtitles that give away little pieces of information about the characters as we watch them, whether it's what happens in the future to them or a secret they have. it's supposed to add a unique twist to what's being shown on screen, but it's hard enough to make sense of what's going on on screen as it is. it's not a bad idea, but it just saturates this film even more.watching vignettes interconnect is always entertaining and interesting, but \"happy endings\" is overstuffed and it creates a disconnect between the characters and the audience, which no amount of character interconnectedness can solve.", "being a great fan of lisa kudrow,(miriam mamie toll) i greatly enjoyed her outstanding performance when she was getting a physical rub down in the most unconventional positions. steve coogan,(charley peppitone) gave plenty of sparks to his performance in a film that dealt with straight and gay guys and gals. this film starts off with a teenage girl and boy who are brother and sister-in-law having hot sex and starting a reaction that continues all the way into adulthood and more. there are many sub-plots that can confuse a person at times, however, the film is worth watching and it was nice to see sarah clarke, (diane) \"24\" tv series who played a gay gal in this picture and is a very sexy gal and i hope to see her in more future films. there is comedy, but i really did not find myself breaking down with laughter, all the actors did an outstanding job. enjoy", "i rented this film out of brotherly love, and it actually starts with a very different act of brotherly love as well...but not the good kind. i didn't even realize this was the director of the opposite of sex until discussing this with a friend.anyways, i don't find this to be a comedy, as it is as bemusing as it is amusing. roos does give a handful of actors chances to go over the top, which works while also giving this a sort of sitcom feel. at the same time, touching upon people's need to have some dirt, or special secret in their lives and using the old movie-in-a-movie trick makes certain this isn't a film that was knocked out as poorly as mamie (often pronounced mommy it seemed to me) was knocked up.the film is a celebration of quirkiness, which thanks to avoiding clichés works okay for me. it actually drew my wife in to watching it with its sort of soap operatic maneuvers. although the series of false endings, then more denouement, then another false ending she found maddening. she also was distracted by the text sidebars that give us an omnipotent wink as to what is going on, and in some cases completely undercut the dramatic tension going on. just don't watch the film with subtitles on at the same time...the idea of the quest for the lost son, as opposed to lost father also was interesting, but this film likes its characters more than its themes i suspect. again, a sort of soap opera strength.i recognized but could not place jesse bradford here, from his recurring stint on west wing as a scion of political privilege. and same was true for bobby cannavale even goofier here than in the \"station agent\" really the whole cast seemed to embrace their outlandish characters and i think that's this film's forte. kind of like watching some nice juggling, and all the balls fall in place ultimately.6/10", "an unsuccessful attempt is made to tie all these loose threads together into one coherent story. even more irritating than the film's third act triumphs is its lack of faith in moviegoers' intelligence. the surface smoothness can't make up for the deeper flaws...it fails signally in establishing any solid emotional connection with most of the people it portrays. trouble is, every character is having problems in a homo-hetero-angeleno world but they lacks substance, each little more than a composite of quirks and one-liners. happy endings is the kind of self-conscious puzzle picture in which characters behave in ways that serve the plot but in no way resemble things that actual human beings would be likely to do.", "having tremendously enjoyed don roos' previous effort, the opposite of sex, i snapped up happy endings upon release of the dvd without knowing anything about it. many of my friends didn't like the opposite of sex; when i asked them why, each confessed a dislike of lisa kudrow. when i noticed she was also in the cast of happy endings, and in fact plays one of the main characters, i figured i'd better shut up about mentioning my latest acquisition to some of those friends until i had a chance to watch it. watch it i did, and i have nothing but good things to report. like the opposite of sex, happy endings revolves around several gay and straight characters, with enough attention paid to both, thus ensuring that the film could appeal to a mixed audience. there is where all similarities end. while opposite of sex had a relatively up-front and focused plot, happy endings manages to juggle several plots and subplots all at once. each of the characters lives touch other characters lives in a style not unlike that of director robert altman. in fact, i kept thinking that the pacing and juggling of the subplots was somewhat similar to short cuts, or even crash (in the way that crash was also compared to altman's style). keeping everyone sorted out in my mind became something of a chore, but i generally like films that make you think and keep you on your toes. there were one or two surprises, including several totally unexpected plot twists, and that's always good too. as a comedy i didn't laugh so much as i smiled, and i asked myself more than once, \"i wonder what will happen next\". as the end credits were rolling i decided i enjoyed my visit with these people, and could easily have managed to sit though even more. how often do you hear that about a movie that runs over two hours?the cast, which includes tom arnold, jason ritter and jesse bradford give even and professional performances throughout. it worked in a way that good ensemble pieces always work; that is, it would be difficult to single out any one member of the cast, as they worked off each other in such a way that no one could expect all the notices. another good thing, in my book. i am definitely going to suggest to my friends that they give don roos another shot, lisa kudrow and all. i can certainly think of worse ways to spend a couple of hours.", "\"everything is a much bigger decision than we think\"sound familiar, it could pass for an independent cinema manta. hey, this is an indie comedy - guilty as charged. it seems the critics has seen all these characters and situations before but what they've failed to grasp is that quirky, ironic, and painfully funny moments are what make indies worth watching and the more familiar the better. not to mention risky casting and this film has all of that and more.on that note i put in my bid for lisa kudrow's first oscar nomination as she has finally broken the 'friends' mold (along with a streak of bad studio comedies) and fleshed out a three-dimensional character. as 'mamie', the abortion counselor, kudrow must painfully convey both a personal secret humiliation while dealing with indifferent patients. as if that isn't enough, mamie also finds herself being blackmailed by filmmaker-wannabe 'nicky', played with needy bravado by jesse bradford (\"bring it on\"), who has some information she doesn't want anyone else to know.another comic actor who also breaks the hollywood mold (so to speak) is longtime sidekick tom arnold (\"true lies\") as 'frank', a role he should have 'paid' to play. why you ask? - well he does get to seduce 'not-one-but-two' of the great actresses in this film and does so with all of the comic neediness one would expect. still, it's a role to die for and he raises his game to meet the challenge.i could go on and on about this cast which is stocked with indie starlets like laura dern (\"we don't live here anymore\") and maggie gyllenhaal (\"secretary\") plus hilarious comic actors ranging from steve coogan (\"coffee and cigarettes\") to bobby cannavale (\"the station agent\"). in fact, it's cannavale's masseuse character (with the hilariously bad mexican accent) that gives the title of the film its ironic twist. and if you like disturbingly funny (albeit intrusive) on screen intertitles then this is the film for you. indie fans unite! - this is your must-see viewing for the summer! it's like a quirky, old friend you've been longing to re-acquaint yourself with - plus it'll help to take away the 'bad taste' left in your mouth by more recent indie fare like \"the ballad of jack and rose\" and \"palindromes.\"check it out!", "intertwining stories cover a group of characters, many of them gay, in los angeles. the characters are uninteresting and the script is a dreary bore. kudrow is a limited actress who lacks the star presence to carry a film. the rest of the acting is not bad, with arnold surprisingly effective as a rich man with a gay son. roos wrote and directed but shows little aptitude for either task. the plot lines are ludicrous, especially the one about a gay couple and a lesbian couple arguing about whether the latter used the former's sperm. most annoyingly, the screen is sporadically split in half and some random, trivial information is displayed about the characters.", "it's 1983 los angeles. mamie toll is 17 and her mother marries a rich restaurant chain english guy. she has sex with her new stepbrother charley peppitone and later supposedly gets an abortion. nineteen years later, mamie

sometimes usual ways. i like some of the acting. tom arnold surprises me by doing real acting. i don't particularly like the closing texts for each character. it becomes more or less like a laundry list of their futures. that only accentuates the problem with this movie. every character has to have a plot and i am suppose to care about them.", "happy endings there was attempt to do something original here, unfortunately, the experiment failed. it's more of a graphic novel with moving pictures than it is a film. we're spoodfed ridiculous amounts of exposition via placards that pop up on the side of the screen like fun bubble facts from a video. and what makes it worse is that it's not an objective, ominipotent narration, but a narration that's written in the spoken vernacular with a definite point of view. if it has a definite point of view, who's writing it? some mysterious omnipotent subjective narrator that we never meet. and we know it's not god, because of the lame attempts at being clever and funny. and just when you think it can't get worse, the fun facts tell us things in the distant past, the distant future, the characters' thoughts, and even what's going on with the bodily functions of some of the characters. oh man. the story lines aren't very good either. i could not see mamie going along with the extortion and the other shanigans that goes on after. i just couldn't suspend my disbelief. most of the dialog was confusing, implausible or just lame. for example, lane tells jude, \"i still don't see the problem. in a month, you tell the old guy it's his... and then when you deliver, it's like this really big preemie... that just happens to look like both of them. we're not reinenting the wheel here.\" yeah, it's the old have sex with the son, have sex with the father and you don't know who got you pregnant. we all know that routine, right? who hasn't been down that road? it's so ridiculous. the storyline with the lesbians and male gay couple is not much better. it's way too purposely convoluted. it's like the filmmakers are digging to find ways to unnecessarily complicate the storyline. and then there's the hallmark of trendy and lazy filmmakers - the corny montages set to trendy pop music to tell us how to feel. and the split screen thing seemed like it was only there to show that they could do it. and why was mamie running willy-nilly at the end? when i heard the title, it made me think of that hackneyed joke about massages and i thought the filmmakers were above referencing a stupid, overplayed joke like that. but, sure enough, that's what they were doing. it reminds me of \"coyote ugly\", another waste of film. virtually every actor in this film is great, but they can't save a script this absurd. it's just so much schlop.", "don roos's 'happy endings' is a splendid comedy drama about complex people and their complicated relationships and pursuit for significance. it tells the story of lost people who are in search of something to feel important. saying more would be giving out too much but as the viewer travels along with these characters in their search for happiness we learn how they find something to hold on to and that a happy ending need not necessarily be the fairy tale ending that we all know does not exist. in my humble opinion, this movie has one of the best endings. don roos comes up with a totally original complex and he tells the story beautifully. the execution is superb and i liked reading the captions. his quirky characters are richly defined and even though they are not always likable, they are sympathetic. the soundtrack is wonderful and it introduces maggie gyllenhaal's singing talents. clark mathis's cinematography is first rate. a cast could not get any better than having lisa kudrow, steve coogan, jesse bradford, bobby cannavale, jason ritter, laura dern, tom arnold, maggie gyllenhaal, david sutcliff, johnny galecki and maggie gyllenhaal in one film. all of them perform excellently. this should be proof enough that lisa kudrow can carry a film as lead actress. coogan too is very convincing as mamie's stepbrother. gyllenhaal and bradford prove that they are two of the finest actors of the current generation. laura dern is very effective in a small role and i like how tom arnold plays the incredibly naive do-gooder dad . i have already watched 'happy endings' a couple of times and it doesn't get old. i don't know if it's the kind of movie that would appeal to a majority of the general movie watchers but it is one of my all time favourite films and i look forward to anything by don roos.", "director don roos' 1998 film 'the opposite of sex,' which starred christina ricci as a manipulative white-trash vamp who shows up on her gay half-brother's doorstep one day, moves in, and gradually proceeds to destroy his life, is one of the most unique and uniquely affecting independent films of recent years: realistic but absurd, heartbreaking but also bitingly, achingly funny, it made a name for roos and set a high bar for his future work, which 'happy endings' unfortunately fails to reach.'happy endings' begins with a somewhat similar premise--a tryst between step-siblings mamie and charley, in which the typical power roles are inverted and the female is the seductress of the innocent and naive boy who eventually turns out to be gay (perhaps sparked out of latency by the trauma of impregnating his step-sister). the film jumps forward in chronology, with three separate, interconnected story-lines in play: the grown-up mamie (lisa kudrow), 20 years later, is carrying on a secret affair with javier (bobby cannavale), a mexican masseuse who occasionally provides 'the full release' for his clients, when an unstable young hipster named nicky shows up on her doorstep, claiming to have information about the whereabouts of the child she gave up for adoption 20 years before, which he will produce in exchange for letting him film the reunion and its aftermath for a film school audition tape. meanwhile, charley (steve coogan) is dealing with his own issues related to parenthood, allowing certain suspicions about the child of his and his lover gil's best friends, a lesbian couple (laura dern and sarah clarke) who had once attempted to get pregnant with gil's sperm. charley manages a restaurant featuring karaoke where one night the curiously seductive jude (maggie gyllenhaal) mesmerizes the karaoke crowd and gains an invitation from otis (jason ritter), a young karaoke d-j who has a crush on charley, to sing for his band. jude shortly initiates a plan to seduce otis' father frank, a wealthy widower, threatening to out otis to his father if he interferes.each of these story lines advances independently with the occasional technique of a split-screen against which roos presents somewhat cryptic textual exposition about the characters' lives and futures--the sort of stuff that would typically be delivered in voice-over by a narrator. the technique is interesting at first, but starts to wear thin until the conclusion, when it is over-exploited to swiftly tie up the meandering plot-lines, which never seem to have the sort of resolute connectedness we'd expect them to have.the big upside of the film is the acting, which, for the most part, is superb. maggie gyllenhaal has an odd look--not traditionally beautiful, but alluring, and totally persuasive as a hipster sex-pot in the mold of christina ricci's dede in 'the opposite of sex,' and she engenders a powerful love-hate attraction in the audience. jason ritter gives a subtle, endearing performance as otis, suggesting that he's got more going for him as an actor than his late father's connections. bobby cannavale is a delight as javier--sooner or later he will get the big role he deserves after stealing so many scenes in smaller character parts. jesse bradford--a more familiar presence in the teen-exploitation genre--is surprisingly strong as the off-kilter nicky. tom arnold all but steals the film as the pathetic frank, whose loneliness and need are matched only by his warmth and likability.'happy endings' has its moments, but in the end, it just isn't as clever or surprising as it builds itself up to be. the ends never really tie up in a satisfying way, and towards the conclusion, the on-screen narration starts to feel like a cheap device to lend gravitas and cohesiveness to the messy plot. furthermore, the film is pretty humorless--a tone that seems unsuitable for a story about confused, emotionally immature people whose real connection seems to be a pathological compulsion to act irresponsibly. roos' knack for clever, quirky characters makes it worth the viewing, but 'happy endings' never gives the audience the 'full release.'", "\"happy endings\" is one of those movies where several different stories are told at once. one story is about a depressed abortion clinic therapist mamie (lisa kudrow) and her secret life with javier (bobby cannavale), another story is about her gay brother charley (steve coogan) who is trying to prove to his lover that his best friend's child is actually his, the third story is about a documentary filmmaker nicky (jesse bradford) who wants to blackmail mamie to make a documentary about her, and finally the last story is about a father and son (tom arnold & jason ritter) who fall for the same girl (maggie gyllenhaal.) there are some other little stories in between but these are the main ones. the film focuses on all these characters and their lives. the results are sometimes humorous, sometimes depressing, but in the end lead to a happy ending.i didn't know much about this film only hearing it was big at sundance and seeing the trailer which was intriguing. i liked the film because it really was interesting to see how everything got connected. the director and writer don roos (the opposite of sex) did a great job with the beginning of the film by immediately grabbing everyone's attention! what i liked most about this film was that you had to think and keep thinking throughout the whole movie because if you didn't you wouldn't understand it. it had so many stories that you had to keep up with and they all did get solved in the end but if you weren't paying attention or thinking then you would have missed one or two of them.the film itself does have a few problems which i have to point out. while the story is very interesting and does keep the audience focused, by the end i think it runs a little too long. i also think that actually making the movie have a happy ending kind of softened the impact of the film. there was a great spot in the movie where everything was coming together and everything just seemed like crap for almost everyone involved and i was like yes! this is going to be good; the whole joke of the movie is the title \"happy endings.\" this is what i thought to myself and if it did end like this i would probably give this film a 9 instead of a 7 but it didn't, it went on to have a happy ending which is where the film lost me. because during the film, it just kept on getting better and better as the stories went on. i really couldn't predict what was going to happen next! but just when i thought that the film was over with a perfect ending! bam happiness had to happen.another thing that annoyed me was the constant written narration borders that kept appearing. it was creative the first couple of times it happened but after a while, it got annoying and really took the focus off what was happening in the film. and the last thing i didn't like about the film was that at times it tried to hard to be funny and a lot of jokes feel flat. it's like those weird jokes that maybe 5 people in the entire audience get.the acting however in the film was just terrific. bravo for the entire cast although i have to mention a few performances that stood out above the rest and those were lisa kudrow, maggie gyllenhall, jesse bradford and tom arnold. kudrow plays a great serious and deep role. arnold's character is also very dramatic and convincing. bradford doesn't play the heartthrob here but the wacky documentary film maker. and gyllenhall's performance is sleazy and cruel. and as a bonus we even get to hear her perform 3 songs for the film.this is don roos third attempt at a feature film, and i think it's probably his best too! it's not a perfect film but it is shot so that you feel the emotions of the characters and feel bad for them at times, and find them amusing at times as well. i think by mr. roos's 5th feature film i think he will be able to direct a film without any errors. this film isn't bad at all don't get me wrong because the story is original and different however it does need a little improvement.overall, happy endings has a terrific original story, great acting, but it has a few down falls and to me the most disappointing thing about the film was the ending. i think the biggest joke this film could have played on the audience was to make the ending an oxymoron to the films title. but like i said already, it's a good movie to see because the performances are terrific and different then most roles the actors and actresses played previously. that and the story alone are worth the price of admission at the box office.moviemanmenzel's final rating for \"happy endings\" is a 7/10.", "happy endings follows a range of people that are loosely connected to each other and tries to tell what is currently happening in their life. it all revolves around charley and mamie, a stepbrother and -sister. mamie dates a mysterious mexican immigrant and is confronted by a guy who says he has information about her son, which she gave a way for adoption after birth. charley has a relationship with a man. we see them and their relationship with their best friends (a lesbian couple) evolve. we also meet otis, who works at charley's restaurant, and his father. they too have some relational troubles to go through and the movie picks up on that too.happy endings starts out really slow. not much is happening for the first hour or hour and a half. the movie just describes a group of people and the issues they have in their relationships. while i didn't mind a slow pace in movies like 'lost in translation' or 'remains of the day', this movie's storyline simply wasn't interesting enough for me and perhaps lacked the subtleties of the two aforementioned movies to keep me entertained during the buildup of the story. it's one of those movies without real action, suspense and -although it's about relationships- even without a real romantic storyline. it just tries to tell a story (a couple of stories intertwined even) about a group of people and what's happening to them in a certain part of their life. i was kind of surprised to see it rated 6.9 currently on imdb, usually the ratings really match my appreciation of a movie. in this case they didn't. i rated the movie a 6 and i hope the explanation above helps some of you decide if you want to see it.", "is there life after friends? the only reason i watch movies starring one of the six main cast members of the show is the hope that some real talent lies there. until now, i must have seen everything except talent. but in this film, lisa kudrow tops it all. i don't think i've ever had to endure such awkward acting, obvious even as she walks into a room without saying a single word. i'm not sure if she was just putting in too much effort trying not to look and sound like phoebe or if phoebe is simply the only character she can play. either way, it was quite painful to watch.the film is basically three loosely connected stories and for some unclear and baffling reason, it opens with a scene from the end as mamie (kudrow) is hit by a car. we are then reassured by the writers - through text that constantly and randomly appears on the screen in the middle of conversations - that she will not die because this movie is sort of a comedy. flashback to 20 years ago, step-siblings mamie and charley (coogan) have sex and mamie gets pregnant. flash-forward to now, jesse (bradford), a young documentary filmmaker, approaches mamie with knowledge about her son that had she given up years ago. if she agrees his filming the encounter between mother and son, he will lead her to him. he needs this to get into film school. she refuses, and in a scene lifted from an 80s sitcom, offers him another story instead: javier (cannavale), an illegal immigrant turned sex worker. javier is actually mamie's boyfriend, a masseur who seems to give out happy endings to some of his female clients.story number two is about charley, who now runs a restaurant and is actually gay. his lover, gil (sutcliffe), had given his sperm to their lesbian friends pam (dern) and diane (clarke) because they wanted a baby. according to pam and diane, they didn't use his sperm but in fact resorted to another source to get impregnated. charley is almost certain that the couple is lying because they don't want to share their child with them.in the third story, freeloader jude (gyllenhaal) buddies up to otis (ritter) because she found out his dad is filthy rich. since otis is gay (and in love with charley), jude finds her way into the dad's arms (arnold), with whom she unwillingly and unexpectedly falls in love.kudrow's pathetic performance aside, the movie was simply pointless. i don't believe that stuffing the cast with gays and lesbians gives any more dimension to a badly written, badly performed, non-sensical script. i seriously couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, whether mamie would find her son, or if gil is the biological father of the baby, or if things will work out for jude. give this one a miss for sure.", "my wife rented this yesterday and we watched it last night. i'd never heard of it. after watching about 15 minutes of it, i thought \"what in the world is this,\" because it was so frenetic. as written in the summary, there are several stories simultaneously being told, and it's kinda hard to keep everything straight. but, after awhile it starts to come together and you begin to pull for one or another of the characters. i've never watched \"friends,\" so i haven't seen lisa kudrow much, but this was a good performance as a girl who alternates between spineless and fed up. i hadn't seen much of the rest of the cast before, so i can't comment. i also think it's interesting that tom arnold was first known for being married to rosanne barr, but it seems that lately he's gotten many various supporting roles, enough so that i find myself thinking: \"yeah, he was married to rosanne whats-her-name?\" anyway, i liked this movie. yes, it's bizarre, quirky, odd, whatever you want to call it, but it ends well. it's one to watch. one more thing: it has many spots where there is a black sidebar with kind of \"footnote\" information. i found myself eventually pausing the dvd to read these things, because i didn't want to miss the music and a bit of action that might be taking place. i wish they would have just paused the movie at these points, and they were worthwhile explanations. thumbs up!", "while the unemployed critic eloquently delineates the failings of roos, huge kudos must be awarded to kudrow, cannavale and gyllenhaal for making the film watchable. both character realization & acting were superb. gyllenhaal is brave to exude a most unlikeable female; yet she is so interesting & complex, you cannot keep hating her. kudrow's maturity - both physically and as an actress - is enthralling. these two deep yet luminous performances keep the film from sinking under the heavy weight of too many characters & lazy explanation cards and limp script and direction. with her hairstyle, kudrow very much reminded me of catherine keener and is growing into her ability to give us a character of depth - not just crazy mannerisms. also, bobby cannavale from the station agent was terrific too.", "when a movie resorts to sidebars to explain the plot, especially as much as this one does, it implies that the writer has gotten lazy with his story development. a well-written movie could tie things together without the self-consciously cute little blurbs. i mean, the blurbs even tell the viewer right up front that this is a comedy -- in case you were wondering??? the saving grace is the acting. tom arnold, lisa kudrow and maggie gyllenhaal give great performances and really make their characters three dimensional. and each story unto itself is pretty interesting. the gay couple story was a bit trite and clichéd as far as the depiction of homosexual couples, but was still serviceable and interesting. i guess if i were to fix the story i would have strengthened the bonds between plot lines or i would have separated them completely. the tie-in between otis and mamie's stories was tenuous and tacked on. it's as though the writer were cheating a bit. here we have some great stories and duologue. the acting is very good. but the writer didn't spend the extra time it would have taken to really craft the story into a cohesive whole, rather than resorting to the whole \"indie\" flick dodge of incomplete, fragmented storytelling passing as \"art.\"", "writer/director don loos has the corner on bizarre, wiggly, frustrating, veritas-infused glimpses at the absurdity of human 'communications/relationships' happening right now. his previous writings (some with direction credits) include 'the opposite of sex', 'boys on the side', 'love field', and 'bounce', all of which explore the desperate need for regular people to find just a hint that their time on the planet makes a difference - at least in some small way despite their larger delusions. his characters are quirky, both bigger than life and pathetically dreary, and cross the lines of the expected borders of types: roos is one of the few directors who consistently plays the 'minority groups' (gays, lesbians, african americans, hispanics, etc) as simply other characters on the playing field of life. and for that he deserves some respect from everyone.happy endings (suggestively referring to the ad promise found in masseur/masseuse in the massage available columns of magazines and some newspapers!) follows the lives of multiple characters whose rather insignificant existences intersect in random ways that produce ten 'stories', all interrelated. topics on the table include abortion, gay relationships, homophobia, parental dysfunction/child dysfunction, emotional manipulation, blackmail, film-making, artificial insemination, failed dreams, and more. sound like ingredients for a comedy? well, no, but in roos' funky hands these incipient tragic topics weave through tragic trails that result in dark comedy outcomes. and that is the fun of the film.yes, there are problems with the movie that others have pointed out well. the gimmick of sidebars explaining what the script doesn't attack, visible on the half screen with scene change action, begin as clever and end up as annoying: if the script can't carry the issues without footnotes then there is just too much information for the viewer to digest. what keeps this movie afloat are the performances by maggie gyllenhaal, lisa kudrow, jess bradford, bobby carnavale, tom arnold, steve coogan, laura dern, sarah clarke, jason ritter, david sutcliffe and amanda foreman. this is a talented cast and at times we feel they are actually overcoming the plot's weaknesses with their strong imagery.every roos film feels like a work in progress, but there are enough fine lines of creativity that promise us someday they will all gel into an exceptional film. this one is too long and too choppy and too difficult to follow with all the visual interruptions of sidebar words to be his best work. grady harp", "this is actually quite a intriguing movie and the three subplots were interesting for the most part. i had to pay attention to this move instead of just listening to the dialogue while surfing the web, because in certain scene the movie goes into split screen. and while the movie is going, the other side of the split screen has certain text that give more info about the characters of what is going on or what is going through the characters mind. which i thought was sort of unique and didn't seem tacky and fit right into the movie. sure the three subplots aren't connected very closely, but it's still a pretty intriguing black comedy with pretty good performances. it's a ballsy and creative movie that keeps the interesting aspect going until it's finished. it would have gotten a higher score from me if the plot was interwoven together more better.7.3/10", "i found the people interesting,not always likable but worth the effort to hear out. visually the story was watchable and shot with vigor and at at times almost like a documentary. the story lines meshed and the twist was understandable. the biggest draw back was too much information (some times). most of the time one cared so much one wanted to stop certain people ,in the story to be quite and not kill a good thing. the bookends of the story were little out of place in that they should have been the opening and the the hospital scene between mamie and charlie. one wishes however more writers would get to tell a story or inter-relating stories with as much heart and warmth.", "in her role as a sexy, unscrupulous gold-digger, maggie gyllenhaal steals this picture out from under the noses of her co-stars. lisa kudrow is excellent as the teen-age mom who gave her baby away at birth -- and she and her step-brother who made her pregnant are sympathetic figures as is laura dern as a lesbian mother. maggie, on the other hand, acting the part of an amoral, ruthless temptress, ready to seduce a young homosexual then leave him for his wealthy father, is irresistible. i don't know how much the sound engineers are responsible for her singing and how much of the credit belongs maggie herself, but she also produces several wonderful moments as a singer, edging her way into an aspiring band. comparing this film to the work of robert altman is an enormous stretch. happy endings is episodic and overlaps several different plots but that's where the comparison begins and ends. altman was a master. this is a journeyman's film: fun but forgettable.", "i might say as a precursor that i dislike episodic pieces...but this movie really takes the cake of awful...we move from one character to the next with idiotic contrivances that are motivated by little more than the directors fancy...the intertitles are juvenile at best and while initially i thought them an interesting tactic are overused to the point when introducing gil and charlie says they \"have been together for five years and will never have a three way\" it was like watching a bad script and reading it at the same time...the only redeeming character was maggie gyllenhall as jude...i could of watched a whole movie about her...although in this one we never know where she is coming from or why? but hey who cares about that stuff.. the only person we have back story on is mamie and charlie and if the film followed them it could have been its saving grace but no we are supposed to care and follow a series of other characters that we have no knowledge of or connection to...i'm not sure how long the movie was, but it felt well over two hours the movie could have been cut down to about zero minutes and it would save a lot of people a horrible waste of time...sorry about the bad grammar the film really had me peeved", "i enjoyed happy endings more than any other film i've seen this year. i admit i had a difficult time following the convoluted plot and that the side title narration did not really help, but i found the film to be most rewarding. i am a big fan of the opposite of sex so i was anxious to see the results of what this writer/director would do with this same kind of material. i was not disappointed. in a way, happy endings reminded me of sideways but was far more compelling. the performances were extraordinary especially maggie gylenhall and tom arnold who gives the performance of his life. the fact that he did not get nominated for an oscar is staggering. this film is not for everybody but for those who appreciate intelligent and subtle film making", "interesting movie. although it makes me sad to think that some might buy into the ideas presented in this movie. the movie is a little depressing and makes one think that life is pointless if you don't fit into the perfect cookie cutter life(perfect wife/husband/children/house) the only person to save from this mediocre life is jesus. just pray to him and you will be saved. it doesn't matter what you look like or what stage you are in your life, what matters is the state of your heart. you could be 33 and have 3 children and your heart be stained because you think you have made some wrong decisions in your life or you could be 46 with no children and no opportunity of ever having children and your heart be just as saddened because you've made some bad decisions. our only hope is in eternal life and the future we have in eternity in heaven. if we focus on these thoughts, we will be encouraged, not saddened. fitting into the perfect cookie cutter life does not mean we will be happy, the only point that we will be happy is when we reach heaven.", "at movies end i was not happy!too many ingredients spoil the soup.", "why is it that the smartest, most potentially interesting of today's filmmakers, people like don roos, and david o. russell, and paul weitz, can make movies that begin to engage our minds, that tantalize us with the possibility of experiencing something really rewarding, but can never find a worthwhile direction for their material to follow, and must wind up disappointing us with conventionality and hollow conclusions? why does a film like i heart huckabees, one of the smartest american movies in ages, finally seem as inconsequential as a fly-fart? why does a movie as funny, as gently off-beat as in good company have to degenerate into contrivance and silliness? and why does happy endings, a film with a certain point-of-view on life, a certain thematic potential, wind up coming off like a cable-tv movie in the end, a little, lovingly-crafted but irrelevant project of the type you might click past a thousand times without ever feeling the need to stop and watch? roos, russell and weitz are men of talent and a certain intellect (more than your average director at least, which maybe isn't saying much, but still), but what they, and many others on the indie and fringe-hollywood scenes, seem to lack is good old native ambition, that little spark of visionary craziness (some might call it genius, but let's not get carried away) that made robert altman, francis ford coppola and sam peckinpah what they were. the problem with i heart huckabees, and in good company, and happy endings, is that for all their brains, their insight into the human condition, their amusements, they are still relatively safe propositions. these are not films that dare much. huckabees may play like an impossibly glib eruption of existential philosophy leavened by self-deprecation, but russell still settles for a neat, reassuring verdict in the end (the truth lies between two extremes - not exactly earth-shattering). in good company may have more personality than any five generic sitcom-style movie comedies, but it still goes for the dumb sitcom pay-off. and happy endings may be an ensemble piece of a certain heart, a certain acuity, but it still doesn't amount to a hill of beans.you can enjoy movies like happy endings on their own pipsqueak level i suppose, and forget the fact that they lack any hint of visual imagination, of technical ambition, of mystery - and you can also eat oatmeal every day of your life (without brown sugar either). those who like this kind of movie will of course defend it by saying it's honest, it's not the kind of movie that needs visual style, it's about people and not cinema - but what they miss by making this argument is that films which demonstrate a stronger, more intuitive command of the medium need not automatically be bereft of the kind of simple human element one might look for in a modest movie like happy endings, that a more formidable sense of cinema may, like superior command of language in a novel, deepen one's experience, make one feel more keenly the emotions, absorb more fully the complexities of the work. compared to a real work of cinema - like zonca's the dreamlife of angels, or von trier's dogville, or even weir's the truman show - happy endings feels like a sketch, a frame-work vainly awaiting fleshing-out. the pieces are there, but the director lacks the sort of imagination that might lead to a work of cinematic merit. the situations all carry the promise of revelation, or at least provocation, but don roos never pushes them far enough, never arrives at moments of genuine climax emotional or otherwise.the multi-tiered narrative centers around the ways personal choice complicates child-bearing: there's a lesbian couple with a kid by artificial insemination, whose gay friend suspects them of having stolen his partner's semen; there's mamie (lisa kudrow), a middle-aged woman who once gave a child up for adoption, who finds herself becoming entangled with a wannabe filmmaker (jesse bradford) who claims to know the identity of her ex-child, and uses the information to blackmail her into helping him with his documentary; there's the charming but black-hearted gold-digger jude (maggie gyllenhaal), who gets herself pregnant as a means of trapping rich, schlubby nice-guy frank (tom arnold, unusually sensitive). the characters are all lost-souls, but whatever suffering they may be experiencing is kept mostly below the surface by roos, who seems more interested in silly devices like doling out exposition via cutely-worded split-screened titles than in the potential of his story to yield emotional fruit. the problem with roos is that, though he may have a perspective on things philosophically, he has no particular cinematic point-of-view. his characters are all defined well enough, and are played nicely, and there are amusing bits along the way, and there's some sexiness (most provided by the gorgeous, palpably erotic ms. gyllenhaal), but there's nothing to really become immersed in, no clever narrative conceits, no big dramatic conflicts, no cinematic hum. one has much the same experience with happy endings that one has with i heart huckabees - one is amused, and almost intellectually stimulated, but then one realizes that nothing is really going on, that all the effort is for naught, and that's when the yawning starts.", "the movie was had interesting subjects and dynamics but i would not say the timing or momentum was outstanding or properly placed. i felt like a scene or two were cut that would have kept me from replaying parts. lisa kudrow, tom arnold and ms jullianhall had excellent performances but it is tough to follow in places with numerous character dramas and how they interrelate later. i think the movie is misnamed and would have named it \"a somewhat peaceful ending.\"", "i loved this movie... in my point of view this is the magnolia 2 ... last year or this year earlier i heard the buzz about crash the movie and how is that the second of the famous master-peace magnolia starring tom crouz ... and i was disappointed when i saw that movie it didn't even get closer the magnolia movie.. but after i saw this peace of high performance and well-written i can say with a big amount of trust that you will not regret the 120 min i used to think that after the ending of the number one sitcom in the history of tv friends i will never be able to believe any of the friends cast in any movie ... after we lived with them every week for the last ten years even when i saw a little bit of cox at the beginning of the longest yard but truly lisa i didn't see that coming... the movie is all about parallel stories mixed togither in a really good scenario.. that felt like it was story of a distny go see happy endings and at the end you will be happy.", "**warning** semi-spoiler alertwell folks, i had my hopes up for this movie. due to the cast and some of the reviews. but...the story line was too convoluted. the characters were not very likable. and ultimately, the \"endings\" were not happy at all. i go out of my way to look for under-appreciated or even quirky movies because i enjoy a broad spectrum of genre's. i was expecting something different but entertaining. unfortunately, although the film was different, it was also difficult to get myself to stay through to the finish. the biggest problem was, from my observation, the director had a \"message\" he was trying too hard to push on the public. he went out of his way to make some of the characters dysfunctional and downright mean, in an effort to make his point. ultimately, not only was the message false, but it made for poor film making.", "the worst thing about this abomination of a film is that it's completely oblivious to how truly awful and inconsequential it is. for the record, i love ensemble cast, intertwining stories and even when they're not perfect, at least one story line usually keeps you intrigued. not the case here.it's so poorly executed that it would be far easier to point out what worked than to pick through the cloyingly terrible carcus of this story. jason ritter. that's about it. not much else, sadly. it was all so clumsy and those irritating narration subtitles! so so so bad.the opposite of sex seems like a happy accident now! not sure what happened to this writer/director, but this was grueling. over 2 hrs, too! he should be ashamed of himself!garbage", "\"happy endings\" is a very fun, very well made film that socks the air out of you in the first minute, and doesn't let up the tempo all the way through to the end. while the sundance guide describes the film as \"supremely self-conscious,\" it's really only in the very best way. we're coming to a place in american cinema where the cerebral ideas of film theory can now be brought to cineplexes, where intelligent yet entertaining films can find audiences that don't want to be talked down to, where cinematic language of shorthand, short cuts and elliptical description is being used to create a new rhythm of communication. no film in recent memory has used it's mastery of cinematic language to pack so much into a movie; with his three intertwined stories that each accelerate, hit the brakes and turn on a dime in balance with each other, don roos jumps to the head of the list of great american filmmakers that can make us think while making us laugh, cry, and really care about the people to whom he introduces us. in a cast of standouts, lisa kudrow and tom arnold really shine, and maggie gyllenhaal is so good it's kinda creepy. jesse bradford and bobby cannavale are perfect foils for each other in roles that are hard to make charming, and laura dern and steve coogan are, as always, sublime. really, a film not to be missed.", "before seeing 'happy endings', i had only heard good positive things about it from friends. after viewing it, i couldn't possibly see what all the hype was about. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either. it's a very so-so comedy-drama that isn't that funny or compelling. in the fashion of 'magnolia' or 'crash', it's a film about different interactions and coincidences of the big ensemble cast of characters. 'happy endings' seems to follow the pursuit of happiness and love between a group of hollywood misfits.mamie (lisa kudrow - friends) is a psychologist at an abortion clinic who is currently dating a swave hispanic masseuse, javier (bobby canavale - nbc's miniseries 'kingpin'). one day mamie is found by a potentially dangerous but overall stupid wannabe documentary filmmaker (jesse bradford) who blackmails her into making a documentary about her finding her long-lost son she gave away as a teenager, when she got pregnant by her now homosexual step-brother, charley (steve coogan - bbc's i'm alan partridge). then we go to charley's story. he still stays in touch with mamie, and has a supportive boyfriend. his boyfriend and him donated some of their sperm to a lesbian couple (consisting of laura dern (the truman show) and sarah clarke (fox's 24)). supposedly the \"gay\" sperm didn't take, but one day charley starts to suspect they lied and that their son is really the product of his boyfriend. charley works in a nightclub where a young gay-in-denial works, otis (jason ritter - john ritter's son). then we move onto to otis' story. he still lives at home with his rich father who tries to cool to be hip (tom arnold), and is the drummer of a so-so kind of band. the band gets a new lead singer, jude (maggie gyllenhaal - secretary) who has sex with otis, but ends up getting engaged to his father - weird-o-rama. 'happy endings' is an extremely dysfunctional story that has a vast amount of potential, but never finds it way into being captivating.i can't recommend this film, unfortunately, but if you sometime spot it on television and there is nothing else on, maybe consider watching it. the acting is good for the most part with strong performances from lisa kudrow, steve coogan, bobby canavale, jason ritter and especially, maggie gyllenhaal who is perfectly cast as a crazy slut. tom arnold seemed to lack some dramatic skills needed for his part and laura dern hardly even had a part. dan roos provides kind of 'eh' dialogue and his direction is nothing to write home about. if you decide to see 'happy endings', i'm warning you, you may not like it. grade: c+", "it's so sad the trash that comes out these days, isn't it? i saw the preview this, and will admit that it was my own fault for even renting it, knowing what i was getting myself into. i thought it would be better than it looked, because it's from the same makers of 'the opposite of sex' which i loved, and was a big fan of. however, this film is almost nothing like that. it's edited the same way, and even has a lot of the same type of characters, but this is a terrible excuse for a film.tom arnold in more than one love scene is enough to make a person ill. it's a twisted tale of a lot of screwed up people's lives, and it's not very good. i'm disappointed in all the actors that chose to make the film, especially lisa kudrow.but, i will say this much for the film. jesse bradford took me by surprise. when i found out later, after seeing the film who he is, i was shocked. he looked and acted nothing like any of the other characters i've ever seen him play. he was exceptionally good, and i applaud his performance.however, this does not excuse the film's disgusting storyline, and pathetic attempt to entertain. it's hardly worth calling a movie, and i hope i never hear anything about it again. i don't recommend it to anyone, and if you don't believe me, go ahead and waste your $2 or $3 on this piece of junk, and rent it, and turn it off after thirty minutes. you'll see why it's so bad. i on the other hand, watched it to the end, and am hear to tell you that, aside from bradford's performance, the only other good thing in the movie were the vocals by maggie gylanhaal. if that was really her singing, which i have a feeling it was, she's an excellent singer, and i enjoyed listening to her. but, these two reasons alone are not enough to watch the film.take my advice, don't watch it!", "\"happy endings\" earns the lowest rating i have ever given a movie on imdb. it is a disjointed collection of scenes involving several people, most of whom have absolutely nothing to do with one another. short cuts or magnolia this ain't. the main \"story\" is about lisa kudrow running afoul of a strange youth who may or may not know the whereabouts of her abandoned son. subplots involve fat old man tom arnold and skinny young woman maggie gyllenhall getting it on (and yes, it's that gross), and a pair of gays and a pair of lesbians at growing odds over the presumed parentage of the lesbians' baby. none of it makes any sense. kudrow should have stood in bed when offered this one. (for those who recognize my writing style, i'm back.)", "this film is about as original as films get! brilliant, wonderful and very, very funny -- don roos is a genius. roos used old silent movie title cards to add to both the story and the laughs -- this devise alone makes the film a must-see. the characters are real, touching and so very human you'll, as they say, \"laugh, cry, and go back again and again\". i had the extreme pleasure of seeing this film at a festival and i could not have enjoyed it more. at a time when the romantic-comedy seems to be dead, \"happy endings\" comes along and reaffirms your faith in the genre; causing one to beg for more films like this one. go see this movie -- you'll love it!", "this is by far the worst movie i've ever watched. the cinematography is lousy. the film is jumpy except when they have the camera on a tripod. the plot, well there really isn't one worth mentioning. the scene interruptions with text are unique and could be a redeeming quality if they had more pertinent information and weren't so frequently mistimed. the girl from friend's must be pretty desperate for work. even though she played a ditz, i think she should have had more brains after reading the treatment or script to not get on board with this movie. i wonder how lion's gate managed to stay in business when they put out crap like this.", "\"happy endings\" is not a bad movie by any means, but it's also not a great movie. it has moments of brilliance, but is an overall uneven film which tries, and fails, to bridge the gap between three different stories being told in one film. so overall, i heard some good reviews by top critics on this film, but i personally didn't get it. it was just okay to me.among the three stories being told, there is a primary one involving lisa kudrow's character and her massage therapist javier, played by bobby cannavale, who frequently gives her a full body massage. the introduction to this plot point was a bit off putting for me, since the \"happy ending\" full body massage initially looked like rape. although lisa kudrow was great in this movie, and can play a no nonsense woman just as well as the ditsy blonde phoebe she became famous for on \"friends\", that one scene could have been shot and choreographed better.however, once the wannabe documentary filmmaker, played well by jesse bradford, enters the film, this subplot begins to get interesting. bradford is also a good actor, and he's funny as a guy whose ambition far exceeds his talent. he brings a lot of color into the film, and i think he has a bright future ahead of him.easily the most brilliant subplot of the movie involved maggie gyllenhaal's character, and how she's a sex fiend who really bounces from man to man. her love affair with the closeted gay character played well by jason ritter was well done, and her scenes with tom arnold were equally great. in fact, this movie is easily tom arnold's best performance to date. arnold is known mostly for his comic acting, but his performance blew every movie he ever did out of the water. he's a very good actor if he sets his mind to a good movie. seeing gyllenhaal and arnold in a scene made me wish the movie had just been about them.perhaps the weakest subplot involved the two gay couples, two males and two females, and the link between the two females' son. what happens is that the man played by steve coogan is suspicious that the son is actually the son of his partner through artificial insemination, even though the female couple claimed the a.i. didn't work. it's not a confusing subplot, but one that doesn't really tie in with the other two stories being told. you ultimately find out that steve coogan's character got kudrow's character pregnant as a teen, but that additional connection doesn't really go anywhere. it maybe could have made a good plot to another movie, or perhaps to a sitcom episode. as a subplot, though, it was decidedly weak only because it tied in poorly with the rest of the film.so two subplots out of three ain't bad, as they say. this movie was saved by especially great acting from lisa kudrow, jesse bradford, maggie gyllenhaal, and most surprisingly tom arnold among others. it had nice touches too, such as the subtitles which occasionally appeared to humorously discuss subplots a bit too complicated to show. however, when you have three major stories being told, the basic rule that should be followed is that they should be tied together in significant ways. the tie ins were not significant enough to me, but the film is recommended for acting alone.", "\"happy endings\" is a beautifully crafted film by director don roos. he is working with his own material in this multilinear tale of loneliness and regrets taking place in l.a., but that one can see happening anywhere in the world. mr. roos returns to the screen with this ensemble piece where he has gathered a talented cast to portrait the lives of the people one meets in the picture. the director is blessed to have worked with j. clark mathis, a great cinematographer, who puts everything in perspective for us to watch.even though the film was meant to be played with many actors without a single one dominating, it's clear that mamie (lisa kudrow) and jude (maggie gyllenhaal) are the most interesting characters in the film. although mamie and jude don't get to meet one another until almost the end, we can see how their lives resemble one another. in fact, most of the characters in the film seem to be lonely, even though they are supposed to be in relationships that on one level shows some semblance of happiness, but in reality they are alone.the first sequence in the film, when mamie is the victim of a car accident, we expect the worst, but never fear, mr. roos cleverly offers us his thoughts in the subtitles to the side of the screen. he reminds his audience the film is a comedy and no one will die in it. some comments here have been negative about that director's ploy, but in reality, they seem to clarify some situations.mr. roos gets excellent performances from his cast. lisa kudrow, maggie gyllenhaal, steve coogan, jesse bradford, tom arnold, bobby cannavale, jason ritter, and the rest, respond well to the director's command. the result is a satisfying movie with a great texture.one of the great achievements of mr. roos is the way he moves from one situation to the next without any effort. the story with all its many situations never loses our attention.", "just what is it with the public, and even the more discerning critics? this makes three art house films in a row that have been even better than i expected: heights, mysterious skin and now the contemporary multiple story-themed happy endings. while i never thought these would break the $ 50 million mark, come on, all are truly superior story telling. like the other two, happy endinds is involving, well-written and cost what, less than one-tenth of what puerile nonsense like the longest yard and the island demand? all three have gay characters, another link. all are modern stories. and all are brought to life by naturalistic, fine performances. lisa kudrow leads a sterling cast, with several name performers who seemed eager to appear even in smaller roles; someone i hardly know, jesse bradford, appears in two of the three films, with talent far beyond what was exhibited in more commercial work. i could have watched another hour of this group of interlocking stories. as a fan of altman's short cuts, there are indeed parallels here, but why would this \"endings\" be considered so inferior? so prepared for talk, sit down and enjoy yourself, i sure as hell know that this one brought lots of pleasure to me.", "this move is actually three little movies in one; it deals with three pretty unrelated family relations - so literally unrelated that they could be separated, re-edited and released as individual films. at first, already in the beginning of the film, seeing several people with large christian crosses around their necks (one on which jeezus hung on) and then meeting the child whose parents had to inform the people with the birthday cake that they can't sing \"happy birthday\" because it would make the child cry (as if saying that he's abnormal for having \"two mommies\" as we are informed in text,) seeing the homosexual guy masturbating to a security tape where a cleaning man is mopping the floor shirtless (as if to say that gay people are weirdoes) followed by a bunch of demeaning gay jokes, more christian crosses, and the gay \"freak\" who has a really hard time pooching this girl (which to \"normal\" people would be easier than screwing in a light bulb,) another gay guy referring to the relationship between a mother and her child as \"a sick, sick bond\" and the chick near the ending of the movie assuring a gay guy's dad that his son's homosexuality is a choice, i thought this film would turn out to be nothing but a christian bullshit propaganda waste of time. it has its clever moments of comedy, fun puns, it proves at one point that lawyers talk while sanity walks, plus it isn't comparable to any run-in-the-mill teen hollywood production, although it has a teenage reality-tv documentary feel, mainly lent from the not very professional directing and camera-work (but it's \"hip\" to make it that way these days, i know.) the way the making and presenting of the documentary which is being made in one of these three relations is being presented one assumes that the writer/director for this film is trying to say that documentaries are as (maybe even less) reliable than fictional movies - kudrow is obviously supposed to appear \"manipulated\" or \"bamboozled\" while watching the finished product (watching it with a large christian cross around her neck). morality all the way (\"this is what will happen if you...\"), as is the referring to abortion as \"ripping the baby out of me and flush it away\" before signing the form supposed to make you think about how inexcusable it is to \"murder people\" by making an abortion on a sperm. also, the text constantly telling us what happens to someone every now and then throughout the film, read, at the end of the film, about max (the kid brought up by two mommies;\" \"max turns out to be straight. this is a great blessing\" - it's just very simple stupidity. but ok, entertaining movie if you have nothing else to do, good actors, blah blah blah, they should spend money making more of these, and so on...", "the only reason i'm not giving the full ten stars is that a couple of plot point moments seemed to go by too fast, but it's just as possible that i was too slow for them. this hilarious and shrewdly observed comedy with at least a dozen lines worthy of immediate classic status (\"nothing says i love you like blackmail\") , and a greater multitude of sly subtle laughs demands a smart viewer to follow some of the breathless but always plausible twists of fate and human perversity. i loved the opposite of sex and this one takes dan roos to an even higher plateau. there is so much compassion and understanding and good-heartedness amid all the comedy that a zen master might have made it. the title cards that glide in and out are like witty little footnotes that wink at the omniscience of victorian fiction while conveying the same degree of illuminating digression. and the ensemble acting is a joy, equal to crash. preston sturges would have treated sex like this had he flourished in the nervous naughts. i think this movie may be a harbinger of the terrific teens.", "it is great to see a film that is so powerful, funny and moving that the entire audience stays at the end to watch all the credits - and this on a friday night in manhattan. i think if robert riskin, who wrote the great frank capra films \"it happened one night,\" \"meet john doe,\" etc., was a young screenwriter today don roos is the kind of writer he would have been. it is incredibly rare to see a smart, savvy comedy about imperfect people and so welcome in this climate of overinflated, mediocre spectacles. what is so interesting is that i do understand the quibbles of some of the reviewers to some degree as i had momentary problems with various elements throughout the film, but was never less than fascinated for a second. but, what is truly amazing is that i found myself wiping away tears by the end of the film without ever realizing how much much i had become involved in the characters lives and how much i had come to know and care about them. this is craft.also, roos must be applauded as a director, as something quite wonderful happens: you realize at the end of the film that absolutely no one actor in the film has ever been done better work. this is not and can not be a coincidence or accident. this is a fine director at work. work this good inspires us all. bravo.", "i've read the generally mixed-to-negative reviews, too, and was pleasantly surprised. on the heels of \"crash,\" here's another ensemble drama with a strong point, as well as smart, sharp writing and a cast at the top of its game. after more missteps than i care to remember (including the disappointing \"the comeback\"), lisa kudrow regains her footing and reclaims her position as the \"friends\" cast member most likely to succeed on the big screen for the long haul. she's nearly as good here as she was in roos' masterpiece, \"the opposite of sex.\" the slightly bloated \"happy endings\" isn't quite up to the level of its actors or roos' \"sex,\" but it's never less than engaging, entertaining -- one of the best things you're likely to see this summer. granted, that's faint praise, considering this god-awful summer. but, again, it's a lot better than you've likely heard.", "ok--a lot happens in this movie! first there's mamie (lisa kudrow) who had sex with her stepbrother charley (steve coogan), got pregnant and gave the baby up for adoption. charley is now gay and living with gil (david sutcliffe) and suspects gil's sperm has been used for a lesbians baby (one played by laura dern). mamie is also sleeping with her hunky mexican masseur (impossibly handsome bobby cannavale) and being blackmailed by a slimy filmmaker (jesse bradford) for info on the baby she gave up for adoption. then there's a young gay drummer (jason ritter) seduced by amoral woman (maggie gyllenhaal) to get to his father (tom arnold). got all that?very plot heavy but never dull movie. all the plots move quickly and are beautifully directed and inter cut by director/writer don roos. also he has (as you can see above) a very diverse cast. i had my doubts when i saw tom arnold and jason ritter in the cast--but they're both very good. actually everyone is good! the cast gives their all--the best performances come from kudrow, gyllenhaal, bradford, sutcliffe and dern. the movie puts all its characters through hell but you have to do that for all the ending to be happy...and they are. just wonderful.there's just two small problems with the movie--it's a bit too long (130 minutes) and there are too many stories--i was getting confused at the end. still, well worth seeing. recommended.", "roos's comedy which shows several stories of love, family problems, and life's unpredictability. i thought the ensemble cast did a good job, and although roos's approach was very admirable, i don't know if he accomplished what he set out to do. the film is an ambitious attempt, and it has good intentions, but it feels a bit misguided at times. thats not to say it isn't good, i actually liked it a lot, i thought it had a great screenplay, good performances, and pretty good atmosphere. perhaps if roos got someone else to direct, it could have been done better. overall a good effort from roos though. imdb rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10", "i was so looking forward to see that movie because of lisa kudrow! i wanted to rent it in the library but it wasn't there so i decided to buy it in a store. to be true i was a bit confused when i'd seen the movie the first time and i was disappointed of the movie. but then, after i'd slept one night over it, i was really looking forward to see that movie again. so i met my friends and we watched the movie together. my friends didn't like the movie! they hated it and asked me why i bought such a movie!? but after i'd seen the movie the second time i was overwhelmed by that movie. and today it is my second favorite kudrow movie!lisa kudrow plays miriam \"mamie\" toll. she listens to young girls who want to have a abortion. miriam got pregnant when she was 17 years old. the father of her kid is her stepbrother charlie. her parents want her to drive off her kid. she drives to phoenix for having the abortion. but she can't do it but she told nobody, even charlie, that she hadn't had the abortion. now 19 years later she meets a guy called nicky. he's a documentary film maker who knows where her son lives. he would tell her if she let him film their first meeting. lisa kudrow shows us in that movie, that she can be also serious and not just funny. i think she was brilliant in that movie. but it is not just lisa kudrow who plays in this wonderful movie! there is also maggie gyllenhaal who i, by the way, really like. she is such a great actress! but in this movie......uh..... she is such a bad person in happy endings! you know....when she sits in the club with her friend she is talking about sleeping with her cousin's husband. isn't that rude? and her cousin was in the club too! and then, when she rotated otis the head, she let him fall and took his father and played with him. but now i know that she can also play a rude person! she's a brilliant actress!laura dern is just a supporting role! she plays pam, a lesbian who has a kid. later in the movie it turns out that gil is the father of her kid. gil is played by david sutcliffe. maybe you know him as rory's father in \"gilmore girls\". he plays a gay who is together with miriam's (lisa kudrow) brother charlie!result: if you love lisa kudrow or maggie gyllenhaal you have to watch this movie. it is a must seen! you will love it, even if you are confused at the first time. sleep one night about it and watch it then a second time. great movie but a bit confusing at the first time that's why i give \"happy endings\" just 8 of 10 stars.", "\"happy endings\" is a modern screwball comedy that updates billy wilder's cynicism that everybody lies and has secrets to these days of blended families, confused sexuality and voluntary parenthood.as in \"opposite of sex,\" writer/director roos sees manipulative straight women determined to entrap sexually confused or naive gay men. but with lisa kudrow he has a more sympathetic central character, as she is able to wondrously combine comedy and pathos, victim and perpetrator, as she means well and is caught between conflicting emotions that we so marvelously see across her face in many close-ups and in her struggling voice.it is nice to see her getting to play a grown-up dealing with grown-up issues as she connects a complicated ensemble of gay and straight siblings, parents and children, friends and lovers, some of whom learn to accept each other foibles and all and some who don't.roos also satirizes a would-be documentary filmmaker (jesse bradford is very funny in the role) who quite accidentally does pick up some truths on screen while baldly self-serving his own ambitions. roos amusingly edits his scenes as if the kid was shooting his own life, with the camera swooshing around in and out of focus.we are laughing heartily at these foolish characters one minute, then caught up in their genuine drama and revelations the next as we learn very surprising things about each one.while the on-screen written narration borders on cutesy, especially as it flashes back and forward in time, it is a relief these days that it's not a character grown-up voice-over, but instead works as an omniscient, reassuring author to tie together a series of short stories about serial mostly monogamy and keep us sympathetic at least some times to characters (even tom arnold) regardless of how far they are going on screen at the moment. the characters have lied to each other and themselves so often that it's hard for those close to them to believe them when they tell the truth.roos not only plays on the double entendre of the title, but on the wording of \"pro choice\" and \"pro life\", as one character shrugs that \"no one would be pro-life once they understand it.\" does roos think anyone should have kids? or parents?the song selections are quite fine, with lots of calexico, and maggie gyllenhaal doing an effective rock 'n' roll chanteuse, infusing billy joel's pop songs with meaning.", "this film was an object lesson--it reminded me not to pay close attention to the professional critics--in other words not to be swayed by them before seeing the movie. thecue cards were very helpful in keeping the various plot lines and characters straight. i found the various relationships, partnerships etc. to be fascinating. the director got incredible performances out of all the actors--there isn't a dud performance in the whole film. some people complained of the length, but i found it refreshing--attention was paid to developing both character and plot developments and none of the people involved were weird, strange or unreal. i really cant single out any one actor as being better than anyone else. after suffering through project greenlights amateurs, it was a pleasure to see a real filmmaker at work kudos to him and everyone involved!", "every now & then, a quietly magnificent film sneaks up on me & manages to both astound me with its craftsmanship & move me poignantly. \"happy endings\" is one such cinematic treat. its power lies in both its contrasting simplicity of cinematography design & its nuanced, depth of character explorations. at no time in this picture was i able to \"catch\" anyone acting nor \"define\" the immediate pov for the director roos. this fine work virtually \"reeked\" of independent filmmaker authenticity while managing to engage a robert altman-like immersion into the prolific ensemble performances which literally transfixes its viewer. the film compelled my desire to \"understand\" both what toke place & why it all happened the way it did. i was absolutely flabbergasted by kudrow's magnificent performance...the camera loved her every scene & her acting went \"toe-to-toe with the incredible yet subtle & nuanced 'performance to die' for by maggie... i had to watch this flick twice back-to-back after thirsting for greater comprehension of each character's motivations...this movie is now ranked as one of the best, stumbled-upon 'diamonds in the rough/underrated gems i have ever seen since i accidentally saw \"closer\" hell, even tom arnold & jason ritter killed in this gem...", "(this film review coincides with the avril lavigne hit single \"happy ending\")let's talk this movie over i hope you have read it was something i did it was something i getthe film does not leave you hanging the characters are not dead they are just held up so high from life's unbreakable threads it deals with many things in life we think we know and things that we could be it was everything everything about interlocking romances homosexuals, opportunistics, immigrants, and thing in life we take chances all the memories of the film were cool to me than it just fades away all this actors did a good job pretending so much for the film \"happy endings\"ok, i will stop my \"avril showers\" singing. however, to reiterate the aforementioned\": \"happy endings\" is a canny, witty film about romance in modern los angeles. the acting was phenomenal. most notably: maggie gyllenhaal as the opportunistic jude, lisa kudrow as the contrived mamie, steve coogan as mamie's gay half-brother charley, and believe it or not that damn tom arnold as the lonely rich frank mcgee which jude takes advantage of so she can join the club of \"me and mr. mcgee\". writer-director don roos contributes a mature, but yet, wickedly entertaining screenplay and construction to the film. and obviously, there is also a happy ending to \"happy ending\". that is my happy ending for this review! **** good", "i think don roos is a very talented writer and director, let me get that out of the way first and foremost. he's smart and funny and cares and has a point of view that is not often seen in mainstream films. so why did i only give it a 7 rating? because it was two hours and ten minutes long, and i just had a hard time caring that much for that long. if it was just 15 minutes shorter, it may have been a classic, but as science has proved- it's hard to sit still for that long.sounds shallow, but there it is.everything else about the film i just about loved- lisa kudrow was brilliant, as was steve coogan and tom arnold and jason ritter- but, as has been noted elsewhere, the movie belongs to maggie gyllenhaal, whose name i've never been able to spell let alone pronounce. she walks away with every scene she's in, and it's a marvel to behold.i was less crazy about laura dern and jessie bradford, i felt that they almost tried to hard to show us how interesting and dramatic they could be, and when you're in the same scene as some of the other marvelous actors, it really shows when you're 'acting', if that makes sense.i wanted to love this film, and parts of it i did, but the overall left me dissatisfied, but hopeful for don roos next film, which i will see in it's opening weekend.", "loved this film. not sure that whpratt1 saw the same film though. they were step children and not in-laws when they had sex and got pregnant. maybe there should be \"did i pay attention\" question to make a comment that will be published.the director did a wonderful job too putting together many different scenes and situations in several locations. not an easy task evidenced by many films today that are shot on one location.i love a good comedy and really enjoyed all of the members of the cast. i would give a strong 10 also to the writers. what a wonderful job of putting together a very complex plot. g", "this is a very witty and occasionally touching comedy involving love and sex, parents and children. although dealing with subject matter involving sex and it's consequences, this is a film for grown-ups, it is not a sophomoric raunch-fest. steve coogan and lisa kudrow, two very fined comedic performers here both do wonderfully in their respective roles, and maggie gyllenhal is good as well.most surprising is the performance of the generally disgusting and unwatchable tom arnold, believably playing a likable and emotionally vulnerable idiot. i have to say, when mr. arnold is given good writing, direction and is surrounded by good players, he can be pretty good.this film didn't do well commercially and many reviewers here were confused by the fact that there are several different interwoven plot threads. probably there are reviewers disappointed by the lack of fart jokes as well. whatever. this film is a comedy produced in the usa that is actually funny and insightful regarding the human condition...that is to say, it is a great rarity.i highly recommend this.", "unexpected, intelligent, engrossing. i haven't been driven to recover my imdb account to write a review for years, until watching this. a very satisfying comedy, beautifully acted, with kudrow and gyllenhaal standing out. the structure, starting in one moment, then moving to the past while giving the audience titles commenting, with reassurances or warnings, surprises and adds to the overall effects of an intricately structured, cleverly constructed story - or rather, stories, that connect slightly and dance around each other. characters who in other comedies would do certain things don't do those obvious things in this movie; people behave like people, for the most part. what's it about? lies, secrets, people lying to themselves, people becoming some part of the lies they tell; people telling the truth and almost always landing on their feet. roos's titles are less explanatory than they first appear; the last one contributes to the overall feeling that yes, this is a story being told, and, like writers, good filmmakers often tell stories about characters over whom they feel little control. showing that to the viewer makes the film feel alive, the characters more real. the music adds both a lightness and poignancy. a few sour notes sounded - the lesbian couple behaved in a more sit-commy, over-the-top way than i thought believable - but overall, this was a movie i was happy to be swept away by, and look forward to seeing again. gyllenhaal shines - but they all do - i never imagined liking tom arnold in a role, yet he comes across as vulnerable, likable, and kind. just about all the actors and characters are equally well-served. in the end, it's clear the filmmaker cares for them, faults and all; it's the message he sends with gyllenhaal's final song. despite fraught moments, broken relationships, gun-pointing, and big secrets, it's rightly billed as a comedy - human nature is celebrated, flaws and all. just outstanding.", "warning: the second paragraph of this review contains some comments that some might possibly consider a \"spoiler.\"this essentially is a movie about the issues of abortion, adoption, test tube babies and other unconventional procreation, marital and relationship issues, including sexual orientation and a phony marriage for immigration purposes. it is not an advocacy movie; rather, it explores in a serious but semi-comic manner how decisions affect a menage of lives.there is a pregnancy resulting from a coupling of a boy and a girl who technically is his step sister although they are from two different sets of parents. there is a child born to a lesbian couple using a sperm donor, whose father may or may not be one of a gay couple who are friends of the lesbians. there is a woman who never saw the child she gave up for adoption and supposedly didn't want anything to do with except ***possible spoiler**** we learn that she notifies the adoption agency of her changes of address. one woman sleeps with a supposedly gay boy and later dumps him for his father. ***end spoiler*** throughout these serious dramatic episodes, the screen writer provides us little light messages that tell us, the audience, a little about how things will turn out and in essence not to take everything too seriously, despite the seriousness of action.i thought the way the film jumped around in time and story line and eventually tied everything together was well done, and the text \"asides\" seemed like innovative resurrection of a technique from silent film days.i particularly liked lisa kudrow's performance (another role she selected that runs counter to the comic character she created years ago for the tv shows \"friends\" and \"mad about you.\") maggie gyllenhaal was also excellent as the scheming temptress. tom arnold was also very good.", "i loved this movie. lisa kudrow is such an amazing talent and did a great job with her character. she was totally outside of her comfort zone and showed her depth as an actor.", "this movie has what 99% of most movies don't have: originality. this is a movie like none we've ever seen. it's clear that don roos wanted to make something different, something that would go way over the line. and, he accomplished that. i loved it. don roos stepped way over the boundaries of most current movie making. i almost consider him the american version of pedro almdóvar. the movie is riveting, cute, original, and most importantly, almost completely unpredictable. the crap that hollywood has been putting out lately comes nothing close to happy endings. kudos to roos and his team for putting such an awesome movie and clearly trying to offend at the same time. i love it when a movie tries to offend its audience. this movie did just that and i loved every minute of it. truth is, most of us cannot be offended and we loved it for that exact reason. we love imaging others watching this movie and by imagining their offense, we enjoy the movie even more. the movie steps over so many boundaries and rules and it's pulled off flawlessly.", "---i'll just present the beginning of the stories,not the entire plots(like in the rear side of a dvd-box) and my considerations about this movie.three very nice stories about gay couples and unwanted kids. -two gay couples (two men and two women:laura dern and sarah clarke;steve coogan and david sutcliffe) are contending a kid. -mamie (lisa kudrow) is looking for her unwanted kid who had when she was sixteen,with his step brother charlie (steve coogan again) -a girl (maggie gyllenhall) is temporarily the singer of a young band:the drummer is the richest one. actually,the three stories are very,very hard to present because are very complex and matched one to the other:but it's also a very good element of this movie. lisa kudrow,steve coogan and maggie gyllenhall give their best in this movie. the younger actors are talented. the only thing i didn't like is the beginning:the crash of mamie.i think it's useless. if you like alternative love stories,you better watch it!", "so i finally got to see this wonderful movie from the guy that did the opposite of sex. it was very touching and quirky and i highly recommend it. however i do think roos, the director, has pretty stereotypical roles he fills for his movies, or at least he does so far, in that kudrow was basically playing the same roll she did in toos and maggie gyllenhaal was the christina ricci of this film. that being said i really did love this film. every character, with the exception of lane, was relatable and sympathetic. i do wish we would have seen what happened to the one character that doesn't get a real epilogue, though other than that i cannot think of a flaw with this film. totally worth a rent if not a buy", "i thought this was better than expected. it has some flaws, and the constant title-card telling us what is going on can be a little too pretentious and overly proud of itself in a way tat does get to be an annoyance, but it also works to make the film feel different from others of its kind. it's a nice sort of quirk, not without its flaws, the acting in this is truly terrific. kudrow excels, as she always does, but surprisingly (athough not really) the best of the bunch was laura dern, injecting so much pathos and backstory and emotion into her little scenes and into her one big scene, which she delivers perfectly. a fantastic actress who's never gotten the due she deserves, definitely a film worth watching. this is definitely recommended, and rather underrated when looking at reviews."]}

this movie.", "so i thought, hey nice artwork, must be a bomb. i was right and i give cage all the chances in the world because he's amazing. this is a sparkling turd from the acting partially but at times it is indie awesome and worth watching ergo 5/10. the camera work and lighting is as junior amateur as you can get, and the dialog is painfully cold read at times. the idea is not new but not bad in itself. the placement and use of sex everywhere is ok, but i don't need to see cage and run lola run bang that much with tv news anchor lighting. silhouettes, in and out of focus, not just bangbros like footage.the nuttiness that is cage shines in points here, but even he thinks \"wtf is this line it is so bad and dry or my scene partner isn't there yet...\" so i have to advise you to watch this and maybe jump a little through it if you can and enjoy the sparking turd for what it is. a new level of \"oh no this was bad but i can't press stop\".", "the worst nicolas cage movie ever produced awesomely bad can't believe it was aired", "this film is not like most others. that is a good thing if you consider most others are either disney or riefenstahlesque superhero movies...great

out. good job!the story was interesting, the execution was good. here and there one could see that the production had some budget constraints, but everybody did a pretty fine job of working with those limitations.cinematography and lighting were unconventional but gave the film a nice look and feel and were thankfully consistent. editing was solid, there was only one edit that broke the flow (a double take on cage).it was a film for me.", "well i saw it and it was not so bad ok it is not masterpiece but it is never bored and the girl is beautiful it is like a tv movie but a nice one so i cannot give one to this but 6 is ok", "don't know what the negative reviews are about. first few minutes into the movie and i was about to turn it off, and i thought nicolas cage is a goner now. but luckily i continued watching, and it turned out to be a super entertaining, twisted, avante garde, quirky, black comedy with an eerie plot and stellar performance by all actors especially cage and the younger girl. but it's probably not for everyone and def not for closed minded people or who get personally triggered by certain things in here cause cage does get intimate with his girlfriend's daughter..lol but it's in line with the story. i seriously think cage should win some awards for this, and it's going to be a cult classic..i will watch it a few times for sure. it's just a wild fun ride", "tye really low ratings are unfair. this is not a conventional film in the hollywood sense- not to say its great but i dare say in it's over blown pretentious way, it takes a stab at art. nicholas cage is original if nothing else and here looking every minute his age, he doesn't disappoint. there's some weird reverence to the female thing happening- there's lots of sex and even one scene where nick has sex with his \"wife\" whilst reading a poem about female juices etc from a booklet titled memories by nicholas cage. sean penn's son hopper says about 4 words yet makes the opening credits. its kind of whacked but cage is bizarre and charming enough to pull it off - somewhat.", "the movie actually has an interesting premise. however, the script and acting are not just bad they are disturbingly bad. it's one of those movies that is so bad that you want to see how awful it can get. i like nick cage but come on, this was garbage. nick needs to lose the beer gut, get better hair plugs and find a better script.....oh and stop marrying women and getting divorced a week later.", "this is so bad it feels like i've just watched a parody of a film trying to cram multiple genres in - badly - at once. the music, the acting, the script, some of the camera work...cringe worthy.", "the story is a bunch of shallow tales that cannot be accepted as neither sci fi, action, nor thriller. it should be classified as \"absurdity, nonsense, ugliness\". for the second time, i get extremely and sadly disappointed by nicolas cage role. first there was the joke of mandy 2018, and now the absurdity of between worlds. this is movie a failure on all levels. acting is so bad and unwatchable, directing is one of the worse, and the story is the worst. at least mandy (2018) had some visuals, but this has nothing at all. so sorry to have wasted my time on this. 1/10, sincerely wishing to give it zero/10.", "i rented this movie for free and i still got ripped off. absolutely woeful. lift your game nic cage.", "ok, being from the mobile area, and fan of cage, i had high hopes for this movie; i was sadly disappointed. please, do not waste your time watching this garbage!!! and if this is what nic cage has become as an actor, he needs to stay away from mobile!!!", "an hour and half of nicolas cage acting weird and crazy in what i can call a homemade movie but it was entertaining enough to keep me watching", "i can understand nic cage doing this film, but franka? if i told you this film was written and directed by a woman you probably wouldn't believe it. it plays like a 15 yo boys dream of what a horror fantasy film should be and as such the writing and the story feel very immature and juvenile. theres almost nothing good here except the occasional nic cage ham-up and its always nice to see franka, though her performance is the worst i have ever seen from her, and penelope mitchell gives the best performance among the cast. the first act is just horrible in every aspect of execution as if everything was done on the first take. it picks up a little bit as there is a kernel of an interesting story but the director spins it out through sex scenes which again feels like the path chosen by a juvenile boy. i really couldnt tell if the film was meant to be taken seriously or if it was going for a b-movie grindhouse sexplotation homage. if it was the latter then it nailed it and if you watch it expecting that you will likely enjoy it for that.", "this is the perfect example of why one sifts through the schlock of nic cage's career (those die-hard cage fans are probably saying \"what schlock?\"). every now and then when europa aligns with callisto, ganymede and io, mercury is transiting the sun and ron jeremy is on a bender, do we get a nic cage performance properly utilized by a director resulting in a stunning and maddening film.it's like a 15 year-old's kinky wet dream or a b-movie adult movie director completely inspired by david lynch sat down one day and presented this to some company that was probably high at the time and said \"f*** it! let's do it!\". you could probably just take angelo's laura palmer theme and put it on repeat in the background (not to say his theme for this isn't good) and i think we would have found ourselves near tears when cage is finally letting his feelings out about his daughter. the film doesn't at all rip off lynch but instead gladly parades around many of his traits and still becomes its own thing. the director, maria pulera, just let cage go (definitely not his most insane) and it works because this character of joe isn't just some crazy trucker, he's clearly at odds with his morality and confused seeing his loved ones from a recent tragic past collide with his new-found happiness.nic cage and penelope mitchell also get a moment a piece that verge on some really excellent acting; reminding me of naomi's career breaking \"acting on acting\" scene in mulholland drive (obviously the scenes here are not nearly as great but the taste of them are there). the first half of the movie gives us some small weird moments entangled in a melodrama and that's really all we think we are in for until that scene where mitchell confronts cage and we get the \"oh god\" moment. and suddenly we are no longer in the realm of borderline step-daughter adult movie fantasy but gut-wrenching, ending of happiness dimension.mandy is still the best film of 2018 but between worlds gives it a much closer run for its money than i ever thought it had the chance of doing. kudos, to all involved, and all kidding aside i think we have officially been not only in the time of cage films straight to dvd, but also in a crazy cult-fandom renaissance of the man himself.", "between worlds: yet another horror film starring nicholas cage on netflix but this one isn't at all bad. he doesn't start to chew up the scenery until the last ten minutes. cage is joe, a trucker who lost his wife and daughter in a fire and is about to lose his truck due to his drinking and overdue loan repayments. he comes to the rescue of julie (franka potente) who is being choked by a guy. she isn't happy about the rescue as she was trying to bring on a near death experience so that she could guide her comatose daughter billie's (penelope mitchell) spirit back into her body. joe agrees to choke her and it works. no it's not a comedy, this works out credibly enough (if you're a horror fan) on the screen. however the spirit which returned isn't billie. joe moves in with julie but billie knows things about him, things she couldn't possibly have found out by normal means.cage is world weary and beaten down in between worlds, he looks like an ailing werewolf. the strange encounter gives him hope of a new beginning only to have this brought into question by billies odd and increasingly crazed behaviour. potente is convincing as someone who is used to having out of body experiences, her first one is chillingly reimagined as she is shown as a teenager, trapped under ice. mitchell portrays a teenager who has a much older mind, a classic dybbuk case. written and directed by maria pulera this is an enjoyable horror/thriller. 7/10. on netflix.", "omg... its like a train wreck. i can't tear my eyes away. i'm grossed out and disgusted.yeah, i know cage is almost broke because he's an idiot who blew through millions and this movie blows, too. all of his movies of late blow as he desperately tries to pay characters decades younger.nick, do us a favor and just shave off all of the rest of your hair for goshsakes!really bad sex scenes of dirty rednecks rutting from which you can practically smell the stank through your tv. the only saving grace is a body double was used in one awful sex scene or else you have to watch cage's aging, fat bloated hairy body throughout as he grunts and ruts like an old pig.only watch if you dare. it goes from bad to worse to worser to worstest. its like it started off with a fairly original premise and then everyone just threw up their hands and said, who are we trying to kid??? this sucks!!!! and stopped trying.", "i never write a review but i have to now. the story line is joke. was this suppose to be a comedy. cage's acting is bad why would he do this show. i have watched some bad movies but this one takes the cake!! don't waste the 1 and 30 minutes to watch this a complete waste of time,", "after spending an hour and a half watching this movie, i've come to the conclusion that the only person who should've been choked is maria pulera.", "this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen. it adds insult to injury that nicolas cage and franka potente were willing participants. it was embarrassing to watch, we would never have made it to the end if it were not for fast forward. all positive reviews are complete lies.", "i cringed into another dimention watching this, the acting (from all parties), the plot, all of it,

going to take you, this is for you. cage is cage, you either like him or you don't. for me, he's at his best in small budget movies where he's the star and \"unchained\". movie was a rollercoaster! definitely a one timer but it was worth it! go into the film knowing it's not a blockbuster.", "between worlds is yet another nic cage b movie where you watch nic cage do his crazy nic cage acting and wonder why he isn't in better movies or at least not doing so many subpar ones. i'm even kind of surprised by franka potente starring alongside him in this as she is capable of starring in better films as well. this movie is billed as a fantasy drama thriller and nic cage plays a kind of whacked out truck driver.. seems interesting enough to pull you in but about 15 minutes into it you realize the acting isn't quite there and the movie is just kind of weird to say the least. nic is entertaining to watch and he kept me watching until the end. if you are a fan of his like i am, give this one a watch and laugh at the strange scenes that are thrown at you. also the sex scenes are pretty hysterical. 5/10", "what happened to nicholas cage??? if he keeps doing moves like this he better start playing powerball. cause he has a way better chance of winning the jackpot than ever winning another oscar.", "disturbing. garbage. cage looked like he didn't bathe or wash his skanky clothes the entire movie. and because all his personal belongings were repo'd along with his truck, i guess he's finally borrowed left-behind clothing from the disappeared husband. fake crying, fake sex, lolita-esque daughter....ugh. run before this movie chokes you.", "i've seen some bad movies recently. hopefully i've now hit the bottom and things will improve. otherwise i may have to find like a 12 stwp program somewhere. the story is stilly but not out of bounds for the genre. the rest is just pure dribble. never seen cage in a movie this bad.", "\"between worlds\" is not a worthy watch on an entertainment level. it's pure trash, and it feels like an embarrassing high school film that the teacher forces the class to watch just as an example of how not to make a film, or write one. it's filled with too many plot holes, too much irregular pacing, uninspired cinematography, and a story that feels like they started principal photography with a half finished first draft. it doesn't keep the viewer interested with it's nonsensical plot threads, and the twist is beyond silly. there's so much sex that it's borderline offensive at parts, like when billie hides and watches her mother and a strange greasy man bang themselves into sexual satisfaction. the set ups are poorly paid off (if they paid at all), such as the scene where joe and billie go to rob two guys who were part of billie's accident in the beginning (both of whom were not bad guys at all). it all feels rushed and bogged down with too many inconsistencies. the only saving grace is nicolas cage does not phone in his performance here, he makes the seemingly eternal 90 minute runtime tolerable, and will provide many laughs along the way, not because that's how it was written, but because cage usually always brings over the top zaney life to an otherwise mundane story, and for that we thank you nicolas cage.", "it has become apparent that nicholas cage is just in it for the money. i wonder if he bothers reading the scripts anymore. this is just another one of his bad decisions. this movie goes nowhere. the acting is bad, the story is worse. it was tough to get through the whole movie. feel free to waste your time watching it. i could have used my time watching this more wisely.", "this was actually a pretty wild movie with some good twists throughout. for all the hate that nicholas cage gets i can't recall a movie of his that i wasn't somewhat entertained by! even just watching all the different facial expression that cage goes through is worth watching this movie. at one point in the movie he's reading from a book that says in big letter \"by nicholas cage\" which i found hilarious. it's a crazy storyline with ghosts and spirits, but on a budget. if you like nicholas cage(which i'm the only one i know willing to admit it) than you'll like this movie!", "watched for the wtf moments, it didn't really deliver even close to mandy. this desperately wants to be lynchian right down to the music but is neither masterful or weird or stylish enough. feels like a student film on steroids. the visual fx are laughable. the cinematic language means little here and is underdeveloped. there are a few great/interesting moments here and there but overall this never gets to a boil and can't maintain a simmer.", "ok that was one twisted ass twist to paranormal possession, but was really expecting more of a horror out of this. weird movie, but nicolas cage really isnt all that bad of an actor. i nvr really did like him, but he really puts characters into a whole different perspective.

supernatural type flicks that try to push the limits and end up being nothing more than a macabre mess. this movie wasn't anything new or spectacular but it did keep me entertained for the duration of

along just fine watching this flick.", "the worst film i have seen in a long long time. didn't make it to the end and forwarded through the rediculous sex scenes which was most of the film. nicolas

weak story and poor presentation. firstly till one hour passed nothing happened there and we could not get hint of subject. apparently we feel it is a love triangular story about a man with his relationship with a mother and her daughter. later we know that this is spirit transfer theme movie, but it is not impressive to connect you. secondly end was made in a hurry and not much explanation. love making scenes are just weird and like barrier in slow going story. actresses are horrible and nicholas is average. why do he do such stupid movies ? we know him for his actions and not for so z grade boring movie.", "right out of the chute, i knew i was about to witness something spectacular. nicolas cage pulls off some beautiful and stunning acting. as a drunk, washed up and needing a wash truck driver, cage yet again doesn't fail to disappoint. obviously when one needs to communicate with spirits, it seems only prudent to be choked. the acting in this movie is nothing short of sublime.

it for simplicity, cage is willing to do with the new filmed, that is something that most front line actor wouldn't do. i kinda believe somewhere in this wonderful world, this kind story could happen, a man literally having three woman at same time. the daughter is a fine actress, with the 90's hardcore music, i feel myself 20 years younger when watching this american tight blue jean. i wish the

nicolas cage movies, back in the nineties. this is awful. the movie, the script, the continuity of the characters, everything is messed up.", "sorry for the misleading headline. but potente has a presence for the role given and cage is exactly what you expect and want. the rest is a mess. weak story, low budget and cardboard delivery makes this a great movie to chill with because that way it may leave you with good memories depending who you are chilling with. watch this if you are a cage fan.", "i excited to see a free pretty recent movie with nicholas cage to watch....the movie was bad....the most unattractive sex scenes, the main female actress kept switching accents and half way through it lost us all with a confusing terrible ending.", "no pun intended - one does not know what happens after death. now that being said, the movie takes this to a whole new limit. franke potente dials it up, but she cannot go as crazy or big as nicolas cage can. actually no one else can.and while he admitted a while ago, that he had to do some movies just because he needed money, he also said that her never phoned it in. that being said, not all the movies he did were watchable or whatever you want to call them.this i kinda liked, because it is as crazy as it can get. and with the mother daughter thing - and the otherworldly theme (plus a past that ... well hangs around, sorry for the pun) ... well it works if you suspend your disbelief enough.", "teenage daughter got excited because she grew up watching the 2010 sorcerer's apprentice , so when she saw this... movie? for only a dollar on cineplex store it was a shoe-in for family night.boy did that get awkward fast.", "first of all i'm a big fan of nicolas cage. he is my one of if not the best actor i know. this movie might appear a little bit crazy to you, but it's actually really good. it's not ordinary story, for sure, but if you watched some supernatural movies before, you'll know what's goin on straight away. and one more thing, if this all story doesn't appear to you, but you like penelope mitchell or you feel you have a crush on her, you must watch this movie, just only for her. the scenes with her are astounding!", "i watched this despite the low rating and i will say i enjoyed it but the issue i found was not that the story was bad or the acting as both was good. the problem was the story felt rushed and left out what could have been an more in depth experience. it was an interesting concept and i found all the actors played their parts well but what could have been a really good thriller fell short. nicholas cage is and will be one of my favorite actors despite the ridicule he gets. i feel people bash him for the wrong reasons. if the script is lacking an actor can only do so much to take a low budget movie and make it good.", "it's so funny, i've now turned this film into a drinking game, and adapted to every other terrible nicolas cage film. the copious amounts of alcohol made this a 2 and not a 1.", "don't waste your time, the worst acting ever, not that cage ever could act in the first place. i was wondering all throughout if anything interesting was going to happen.

that, expect to be very dissapointed, as nothing in this film works. it's story & writing was predictable. mr. cage over-acts not that he doesn't do that most if the time but here it doesn't work. the rest of the acting/actors is/are sub-par. i fell asleep in the middle and had to re-watching what i missed. i enjoyed the nap more than the movie.", "shockingly bad. bad acting. bad storyline. just avoid it you'll thank me later", "but i did stop watching when i was convinced that it was soft porn masquerading as sci-fi something... i thought i'd better check the rating here again...i i sure didn't seem to be consistent with the number i saw here when i first considered watching it. sho nuff... much more consistent with my experience...t th woman/mother lead's acting was so bad, i began wondering what was going on... the dialogue/writing wasn't helping any... but i kept watching because cage is hilarious!!! it seems as if, at least beginning when he goes back to their place and starts doing elvis at the door! i had the feeling he'd decided that he was going to singlehandedly save the movie by going nuts... i, unfortunately, will not be going back to watch the rest...so i'm not sure just how far out cage is going to go with this one...i did get him to promise to report in when flying overhead...", "awful acting including from cage, particularly at the finale, almost switched it off a few times but thought maybe this will get better.. it didn't so in reflection i really wish i had turned it off.", "enjoyed the film very much! don't expect an oscar winning thing,

are not satisfied with this film, it certainly kept me properly entertained.", "right or wrong, i'm a fan of most of nicolas cage's movies. i know some of them aren't so hot but you usually get what you paid for. that said, \"between worlds\" isn't up to snuff. there a decent story buried in there somewhere. maybe they shouldn't have played it so straight. some laughs would have helped. also, all of those flashbacks and flash-forwards didn't help either. i think they were put in to stretch out the movie's running time because they don't help the story any. cage is always worth watching but

was it poor acting i tured it off because my adult son walk in the room and asked if i was watching crappy porn!", "bad script, lousy acting, nicolas cage is one if not the worst actor in the last 60

much here in drama, acting or suspense. wasted talent.", "great talents wasted on a poor execution of ideas. the score didn't fit the energy or content of the movie. in fact, different music may have made all the difference. it was weird in the worst of ways.", "i promised myself that i would keep this short. it was hard to watch, after all, it was a nick cage movie. kidding, kind of. i wanted it to be enjoyable but uncomfortable guffaws and laughs came from the actors themselves at all the wrong times. conversation was painful to watch as it was forced and unnatural. the movies plot was so transparent that everything was expected. what plot points that did exist were uncomfortably thin. it got to the point early on that i was expecting bad judgement, wrong decisions and selfishness at every turrn. it was truly painful to watch, but then it was a nick cage movie. don't get me wrong, i like a lot of his work but i expected more, and more from franka too. i enjoyed her performance opposite matt damon a few years back. but alas, my faith that this film would be enjoyable was for naught. unfortunately, here is another hour and a half i can never get back.", "pathetic. it amazes me how stars like nicolas cage can attach themselves to scripts as bad as this. i know he needed money but there's lots of great scripts out there that never see the light of day. the problem with hollywood and netflix is that they don't care anymore about quality. it dumbs down audiences and they don't seem to want to produce anything memorable outside the fact that it's memorable for being bad. i'm just glad i didn't have to pay extra to see this p.o.s.", "ugh...like watching a car wreck! nicholas cage is at his all-time lowest!", "this is remarkable in its every aspect. don't even know where to start. it made us laugh, like in bug ass spider laugh. the director of photography, assuming there was one, maybe a lut in post, is about the only redeeming quality. i am used to over actor cage but to see bourne girl franke potente struggle with the unbelievably bad writing was heart wrenching. if you had this script handed to you for a grade school drama class the class would be in stitches. how's this even possible? it's racy, the first time cage is with franke they have a romp on the sofa, complete with jostled coffee and if you're paying attention a broken table lamp, the lamp of course appears unscathed in next cut, whole and i damaged. this might not replace the magic of the first sharknado, or the low budget camp of pinky tuskaderos \"new years evil\" but it's almost bad enough to be fun. i couldn't hang on for more than thirty minutes, i wanted to, i tried my best!", "y'know, i don't think mr nick cage is a great actor but this movie has me going wtf cause it's a new low even for him. entire plot is nicholas cage drives a truck for 5 seconds and then drinks 100 gallons of soco in his girlfriend's single wide trailer while he screws her daughter on the downlow.", "dont waste your life to watch this movie, better watch student movie", "i got the premis of the film but several scenes just didn't make any sense and left me confused. they didn't add anything to move the plot forward and wondering why they didn't end up on the editing floor. the actors performances were disappointing and not much chemistry between any of them. aww, and the gratuitous sex thing between mom and old guy then 18yo daughter. then of course add in the choking theme, which was almost a character itself. i don't normally write off films that don't make sense to me and i'll give them another view. but not this one.", "nick cage just keeps getting worse, ever since he effed up jhonny blaze. in this movie, he's a trucker who lost his wife and daughter in a house fire. he steps up when he sees a woman being choked in a truck stop bathroom, and he thinks he saved her, but the truth is, she can travel to the spirit world, and her daughter just had a bad bike accident, and they were losing her, and her mom wanted to be choked to try to bring her back. cage falls for the mom, and his already bad standing with the delivery company got worse, because he stayed to help the family. i abhor spoilers, so i won't be giving any, but i'll just say that the problem the movie revolves around is that her daughter isn't who she brought back.i thought for the first half hour this might end up being a good movie, but it just kept getting worse and worse. i only kept watching, because i believe you can't give a movie a fair review without fully seeing it. if you watch this, good luck!!", "this movie was so bad, terrible acting, the story mad no sense, and i have no idea what the last scene in the movie had to do with the rest of the movie. what ever happened to nicolas cage.", "cage is a curse for the hollywood movie industry...", "is this real? this is the worst script i have ever heard. and this chick is a horrible actress. absolutely horrible. this is what happens when you allow someone to write, produce, and direct their own movie. ugh.", "i stumbled upon the 2018 fantasy thriller by random chance in 2021. and since it was a movie that i hadn't already seen, and the fact that my wife is a fan of nicolas cage - for god knows what reason - i ended up sitting down to watch \"between worlds\".and i found myself to be between words. this movie was just strange, even for a nicolas cage movie. sure, some of the concepts of the storyline was interesting, but the movie was just painfully awkward to sit through, especially with the thing going on between joe (played by nicolas cage) and billie (played by penelope mitchell).the story told in \"between worlds\" was somewhat of a stretch. sure, there were the whole thing with a spirit coming back to inhabit a different body which was interesting, but most of the rest of the storyline sort of fell short of being entertaining.the acting performances in the movie were adequate, at least the ones put on by franka potente and penelope mitchell. \"between world\" does not rank among any of the top performances put on by nicolas cage, no, in fact it was cringeworthy to watch him stumble through this movie.\"between worlds\" is a movie that came and went without leaving much of any lasting impression, and while having sat through the entire movie, i can honestly say that this is not a movie that i will be returning to watch a second time. just another run-of-the-mill notch in the belt in the acting performance of mr. nicolas cage.my rating of writer and director maria pulera's 2018 movie \"between worlds\" lands on a generous less than mediocre four out of ten stars.", "do not watch it. no redeeming qualities. full of obscenity and too much drug abuse. it uses indecency and obscenity in order to try to replace a good storyline, great acting, and a need for good graphics, all of which it doesn't have.", "don't get me wrong i like a bit of a cheesey film, but this is just amateurish, worst film i've ever rated. i'm quite fond of nicholas cage (con air, face/off) but the mighty has definitely fallen :(", "it's based on rebirth type fantasy it's just mixup of the billy and mary named two ladies acting of billy is really up to mark idk what's happening in movie and is it possible??", "cage finally hits what i'd call rock bottom acting wise. his narcissism and need to feel like he's a good actor actually make me feel embarrassed for him. this movie like in so many others cage just tries too hard to bring forth a character, but you still know it's cage trying to hold onto his uncle , frances ford coppola's coat strings. he changed his name to cage so viewers would think he was a good actor w/o the famous family name. in my opinion that never worked out for him. he'd probably would have been a better \"behind the camers\" type guy , instead of a in front of the camera type of guy. with that said i'm sure he's a really nice guy in real life.", "there is something about nicolas cage's acting that i truly enjoy. his over acted psychotic scenes somehow always feel right and this movie has a couple of them.unfortunately many of the movies he acts in are crap and this movie is not an exception to that. at five minute mark i already know that the story and plot will be unoriginal and awful, much like stuff i wrote in school when i was like 13 years old, yet i have to keep watching and this is what happens to me with 99% of movies starring nicolas cage.with a different actor on the main role this movie wouldn't be worth two seconds of my time and i would likely give this movie one or two stars. the acting on other roles is mostly ok but no matter how good the cast is, it cannot fix bad writing.it saddens me that he doesn't seem to be able get many roles in better movies, though i still enjoy watching his work.", "kept waiting for the nc magic...just didn't happen. no chemistry between joe and julie. good thing for big trucks, cause the plot had holes big enough to drive trucks through.", "my thought after getting to end of this movie. i used to think nicholas cage could do no terrible movies until i watched this... i'm really at a lack of words to describe this movie. it had a decent plot that could've been executed better especially with the cast but it just fell below the mark. eh don't waste your time on a good day when other movies are available. save this for a bottom of the barrel type movie day.", "many times you ask yourself ,how can i spend my time watching something worthy ?! this is how! great cast , great story, scenario , pacing, and that feeling about wanting more and more !", "i genuinely don't know what's worse, this or adam sandlers jack and jill, yes it's that bad.", "when you're a fan of so-bad-it's-good movies, it can be tricky to seek out the next masterpiece. there will only ever be one \"the room\" and even the neil breen filmography is a relatively finite resource. however, nicolas cage's body of work is a virtually limitless well of untapped potential. he's been spitting out several films a year for over 40 years, and they range from actually fantastic to hilariously bad to simply unwatchable. this can be tough to navigate, but it's all the more special when you stumble on a gem like between worlds.casual fans of of cage hilarity would be advised to start elsewhere, as this thing can be a rough watch at times. to get to the good stuff, it tests your patience with a lot of really boring garbage. but trust me, once it gets there, it doesn't hold back, and had me howling with laughter.it's quick to unleash it's ridiculous premise, a girl who can communicate with the spirit world when she's being choked. you think you know where it's going with this stupid idea, but then it switches gears and becomes a painfully slow love triangle drama and you question why you've subjected yourself to this in the first place. but patience my brother, because once it hits it's big twist in the middle, things go off the rails.between the made-for-tv quality and ludicrously implausible plot, it's already on a beeline to b-movie, but as always, the fantastic mr cage takes things to the next level. his over the top melodramatic shtick is in full effect, bringing humour to what should otherwise be very sad situations. you've gotta wonder how much he contributes to the writing as such absurdities like bringing up the exorcist during sex, or the line \"why don't you wrestle a man gator\" only seem like they'd be possible coming from his mouth.if you're looking for a new flick to mock and watch, and have some like minded friends who will talk over the dull bits with you, this can be a blast. if that sounds like too much commitment for something that's ultimately trash, i'd recommend youtuber elvis the alien's half hour summary.", "this movie had potential but then turned into sex and soft porn. i like to see nicholas cage in thrilling movies looking like a human. i don't recommend this movie at all!!", "there is something strange going on here. the actors stare straight at the camera instead of looking at those they are speaking to. in the second appearance of mike and rick--this time at billie's house--the actor who is not sean penn's son has a couple paragraphs of script speaking to billie's mother but he doesn't look at her while speaking because he is staring straight at you, the viewer. billie is also an audience starer. it gets sinister!nicholas cage seems to have improvised 80 percent of his dialogue (and not in a good way). the set design is atrocious, and why are the establishing shots all crooked with a large diagonal 'something' cutting across them? and jesus! i think there is a historical amount of product placement in the first 15 minutes.it's been an hour since watching and i'm still weirded out by the entire experience.", "i wish i could give this poor excuse for a film a zero or even minus-10 stars. confusion reigneth here. it is almost impossible to follow the plot. how did a fine actress like franks potente get roped into this mess? cage's performance was pathetic, especially in the end shots. give this \"film\" a wide berth.", "the worst sin this movie committed was attempting to be good. i could tell it was trying, maybe even the actors tried. the idea was interesting, the execution was haphazard at best. nothing really makes sense, but just go with it lol", "it's been a whiles since i reviewed a movie, but this one had too many high fake reviews to not warn people off. i gave it 3/10 because i compare all bad movies with the worst movie of all time, wicker man, so this gets a three. the movie had a great premise that was executed in an incredibly bad way. i always pull for nick cage to get back to his former glory, but at this point, i've given up hope. nick cage plays a down on his luck truck driver who's acts like he's trying to channel the spirit of elvis presley. i can't decide if this is a really bad supernatural thriller or a black comedy that's trying to go everyone's head. watch it if you will, you've been warned. if you have time to kill on this, check out wicker man (i'm still pissed about that movie and want that time back!)", "bad script, bad acting, bad everything. tried to be a comedy sometimes but not funny. tried to be a thriller at times but not thrilling. not horror, not sci-fi. really the only word for it is crap.does cage need the money or something? why would he make something like this?", "it wasn't great, but it wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be. kept me interested.", "stupid sex loaded movie with stupid story. bad acting, neither action nor horror nor drama.cage must be desperately needing money to play in this movie.2 stars for this crap is ample.", "i watched this thing in fast forward with my besties, i guessed the rating then checked. at 2600 reviews it was an exact 4.0. i feel powerful.", "not even worth watching the trailer, shockingly bad.... how the mighty have fallen.", "question is why. i'm a long time, hard core nic fan. obviously poking fun at 'white trash' stereotypes; insulting further by doing it so badly. no s. accent, a norm. a small attempt was made. it's as if there was one dry run for rehearsals. nick, drugs? is that it? or are you making fun of southerners, badly on purpose? guilt? wth? potential was there for a decent movie but a mess on purpose, surely. i had to see it thru, even being told not to bother. it must be a dare, making fun of alabama/southerners, or you owed someone a favor. i'm going with taking a dare because i've loved your movies for so long. there's an inside joke with this one. idk why cage is doing this again and again. maybe paying dues. i'll always watch him in anything. this was the most painful i recall. we like to think the best of our faves. this one really has me wondering if he's gone off a deep end personally or, as i said, dares, favors or jokes. they didnt even try on this one! smh. make a come back cage. your scaring me! the last scene, clueless.", "if it were the last movie on earth, i'd unwatch it. being a big nicolas cage fan i've got an generous amount of patience for him but this movie spent it all. directorship, story line, acting, dialogue - nearly everything about this movie was terrible (pros: the camera angles were at least ok). in all fairness the little twists near the end were at least worth 1/10 stars, not withstanding the jack in the box moments (leaving it at that to avoid a spoiler).the movie was already on \"icky\" ground when we were made to watch two post-middle aged frumpy figures get their bump on. cringe factor ran deep to the point that i'm pretty certain nick and franka were asked to \"put on some pounds\" to edge towards torrid. to add to the trauma, seeing cage in a banana hammock was just not copesthetic. definitely magnitudes worse than \"bringing out the dead\", and sadly a slap in the face to the two leads' epic classics (raising arizona, run lola run) i'm hoping the memory of this one can be drowned out without me myself chasing rx cough syrup. raunchy dark and groddy. not sure if it would be slightly better or slightly worse if f&l lv 'raoul duke' was the main man instead. either way, i'd almost like to have cataracts to have dealt with half the execrable content.", "this is the worst nic cage movie i have ever seen. however i watched the whole thing because it was nicolas cage. i would encourage you not to start watching this film, and talk a walk or do your dishes instead. some of the images are burnt into my head unfortunately. a good time and a happy ending is not in this movie. parts of it, especially the sex, are just yuck."]}

series \"money heist,\" seamlessly blending moments into the story. the past and present narratives converge brilliantly, unraveling a tale of heroism, redemption, and the pursuit of justice.here are some of the things that i particularly liked about the film:obviously shah rukh khan!seeing nayantara in action.the action sequences are top-notch.the plot twists are well-executed.the film has a strong emotional core.the performances by the cast are excellent.the film deals with important social issues.i would definitely recommend 'jawan' to anyone who enjoys action thrillers. it is a well-made film with something to offer everyone.", "i just could not believe my eyes when i was 30 mins into this piece of trash. how many times was this story done in the 1989s in hindi as well as south indian movies? why is it being repeated shamelessly in 2023? just because it's srk movie? seriously? then, another major concern is that if this is the future of tamil-hindi cinema collaboration, i am happy with watching selected hindi movies only. let me explain. typically tamil action movies with superstars(like rajnikant) have each and every action scene either in slow motion or all the vehicles are running in 1.5 times to 2 times the speed, same for bikes! doesn't stop there, it is exactly the same with dialogues, the last words of a sentence are not over and the editor keeps switching to the other person eith such a speed that even in delicate romantic scenes there is no delicacy. till the end, it was like watching an anime movie with no respect for a cinema viewer's sensibility. no, this movie is an action movie you will say, but the rhythm of the action, dialigues and editing is something that probably the tamil audience is used to watching and i respect that fact. just that the editing and rhythm is totally different from that of hindi movies, and hindi movie viewers are used to a certain rhythm of dialogues, movements, a certain gap between dialogues, etc etc. this hindi movie directed by a tamil director feels like you are watching a tamil movie dubbed in hindi, in each and every scene!! throughout you get a feel you are not watching a hindi movie at all, something is alien, something is missing. all the songs except for the end title one. do not sound like hindi movie songs either. if this is how the future of tamil hindi movies collaboration looks like, please give us a hindi movie directed by a hindi language understanding director only, please please!! this movie was a torture to watch. hope you understand hindi movie producers!! thankyou!!", "this is cinema, peak entertainment. insane theatrical & cinematic experience, got goosebumps all over. i cannot properly explain the spectrum of emotions i went through, want to live in that moment forever. it's wholesome seeing shah rukh khan in this badass massy avatar, literally a dream come true. his screen presence is at an all-time high, he clearly had the time of his life. will forever be grateful to atlee for this. this has one of the best interval block of all time & one of the best srk entries. so many elevation sequences, you will feel the chills. action sequences packed a big punch and they are only elevated to another level anirudh's bgm. srk broke the 4th wall during his monologue to talk to the audience in his unabashedly political avatar and giving his stance, was extremely powerful. the theatres erupted during zinda banda & not ramaiya vastavaiya and people started dancing, that was crazy. even imax turned into a single screen. it felt so good dancing with other srk fans.deepika in her limited screen time left a big impact. the way she emoted i felt her pain and she made me very emotional. nayanthara has that aura & power and i understand why they call her lady superstar. they both were stunning. vijay sethupathi was very menacing. other cast members did really well too, the girl gang were on fire. some of the scenes made me cry, no kidding. the emotions hit right on point.to sum it all up - anirudh did his thing, atlee cooked his magic & srk in his charismatic & electrifying best. add cool characters & cast, emotions, revenge, mass action & elevation sequences, powerful music, strong social message, colourful visuals and we get this beautiful entertainment package called jawan that captivates audiences from start to finish with proper blend of masala elements. it's a treat for srk fans & neutrals alike.after watching thrice already, i can definitely say it has an insane repeat value and gets better & clearer with each rewatch. will watch again. audience is in for a nonstop cheers, whistles, claps, shouts, cheering & hooting ride, i am still having a sore throat from all that. it's not a film, it's an emotion that will make you smile and give a heartwarming feeling.", "'jawan' is the one of the best movie in 2023. action, thriller, drama, mystery, adventure has all in this film. no doubt, 'jawan' is a constantly engaging and entertaining film.let's have a big round of applause to director atlee, for his mind blowing direction and also story. he gives a social message in action relevant. he presents some sequences, which really touch your heart. anirudh ravichander gives proper background score. g. k. vishnu's cinematography is great.the action of this movie has to be said separately. some action scenes, do not let the eyelids fall.talking about performances, shah rukh khan (vikram rathore, azad), vijay sethupathi (kalee), nayanthara (narmada) are the lead characters in this film.shah rukh khan represents seven looks, that sets it apart from other films. his acting will really impress you once again. his fitness, style, and action really worth watching. along with srk, vijay sethupathi holds his place properly. he proves himself as a proper villain in this film. his hindi speaking style is very interesting. nayanthara portray her character very well.the supporting actors, sanya malhotra (dr. eeram), priyamani (lakshmi), sanjeeta bhattacharya (helena), lehar khan (kalki), girija oak (ishkra), aaliyah qureishi (jahnvi), sunil grover (irani) and others acts very well.in a cameo roll, deepika padukone (aishwarya rathore), and sanjay dutt (madhavan naik) won our hearts.-rajma koley.", "the film is entertaining to watch, it's worth for every single penny you spend. trust me it forced me to scream out of excitement in theatres. srk at 57 years of age proving to be the only pinnacle of indian cinema whose legacy will be unmatched for generations to come. just single word for whole movie and atlee's direction too, i.e. wow! best pan india movie in the history.i went into theatre with my friends for very first time and i was not expecting this much from this movie but guess was it took me by surprise, i got stunned watching the very first shot itself. i hope whole world's movie lovers understand the value of this man shahrukh khan.", "just saw jawan out of love for srk and found it just like any other tamil n telugu style action entertainer.i just don't understand why south directors have to shoot all actions scenes in slow-motion. slow-mo action does not look gud infact it beats purpose of true pleasure of viewing action on large scene. south style action is boring to me.srk is simply srk, love him. senior srk role was best. deepika looked old and same crying lady as usual.vijay sethupathi acting looks repetitive, vijay sethupathi is not versatile enough imho. in this movie i felt he was doing comedy in end while fighting with srk..i mean what... atlee c'mon..generous 7/10. movie makes must raise standard.", "the movie was entertaining with blend of a lot of drama, little comedy, some thrill, some suspense and a lot of action. the story was good with a good message in it, the screenplay was uneven but doesn't damages the story, the direction was good and the performances were also good. the bgm and the action scenes were great, you will love them. also, the message the movie wanted to show was good and effective.some scenes were rushed and some things remained unexplained but the story is shown in such a grand way that these things will not bother you that much.overall, you should definitely give this movie a try.", "so, i just came from my show of jawan, and this was an exhilarating three hours, and i have tons to discuss.since all my theatre viewings have incorporated a different review format (detracting from my analytical perspective), i will make no exception here. i will put forth the positives and negatives like i did on all occasions.without further ado, let's begin and let me first start with what did i like.positives:-technicalities - i cannot stress enough how rich and gorgeous the film looks. each and every shot was infused with fitting colours and contrast.shah rukh khan - we have never seen shah rukh khan in such a massy avatar before. what atlee kumar had done with him here is exceptional, and bollywood directors should take notes seriously. kudos to srk, too, as he had completely surrendered himself to the director, putting faith in his vision.emotional core - those who have seen atlee's earlier works know how much importance he generally gives to the emotional aspects of his stories, and \"jawan\" is nothing different. you will shed some tears.background music - anirudh had yet again shown his true worth. what a terrific composition. it had uplifted and exacerbated every sequence! it's one of his best, for sure.yeah, that's about it. now, i am moving on to the things i did not like or had qualms about.negatives:-third act and its mishaps - the concluding act, or the last thirty minutes to be precise, came off as volatile and incoherent compared to the rest of the script. it seems like atlee had made some last-minute changes or was in a great hurry to finish off the screenplay and, in doing so, ineluctably messed up the inherent flow of the narrative.tonal misbalance - it might sound nitpicky, and maybe i'm doing just that, but embedding comedy in serious moments didn't come across as a wise call. it took away the intensity and made the situations less intimidating.lack of material for the supporting cast - i knew the supporting actors would have little to do here, and my assumptions were proved correct. nayanthara, sunil grover, the six girls: although they did whatever was demanded of them, their characters leave a whole lot to be desired. there were opportunities to make them shine and come out of their shells, but atlee didn't; it was deliberate from his end.now, it's time for those things i have mixed feelings on.mixed:-cameos / guest appearances - there are two special appearances in the movie (no, thalapathy vijay is not there if you are wondering); one from deepika and the other one comes from a veteran in the business (not going to name him though, you will see it for yourself).now, i absolutely adored deepika here. she was given about twenty minutes of screen time, and she gave it all and made her part so impactful that you'll remember her after the film finishes. sadly, i cannot say the same for the \"other\" cameo, which felt more like a last-minute touch-up or an input from the producers' end rather than an indispensable part of atlee's pre-planned vision.messaging - each and every message in the film bears significance and the topics they speak about need to be brought up in our day-to-day conversations. having said that, i did not like the way those messages were delivered, especially towards the end when srk breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience. it was fine at the beginning but became so preachy by the end!to summarise my train of thought, i had a very good experience overall, and the community viewing aspect definitely played its part. despite a couple of issues, i suggest everybody go and witness this spectacle of a feature on the biggest screen you could afford to go to. if you love srk, it's a must-watch no-brainer; even if you do not consider yourself a fan, go for the exhilaration. trust me, you won't have much to complain about.", "thank you so much atlee for making this action rollercoaster which is full of emotions, tears and laughters.jawan is easily srk's career best action movie, direction wise atlee is way better than all bollywood directors. especially in this genre.senior srk's swag is unmatchable, anirudh's bgm is extraordinary. all 6 girls acting was on point. train sequence is too good but that is not the highlight of the movie there are 7-8 scenes where you can compete jawan with action movies like the matrix.nayantara is gal gadot of indian cinema, her few scenes are batter than many bollywood actresses whole career yes she is that good.don't think twice experience this masterpiece in cinema asap.thanks srk & atlee for this experience. all records will be shattered.", "the movie can be judged from 2 perspectives, the first one is emotional and the later is rational. let's judge it from the second one as it is often a rare element to witness.this movie is a disaster. all the basic pillars which make up the foundation are hollow. acting is cringe af, story & script is a copy paste donkey work done by the director. music is average, action scenes are good but stand on baseless & senseless legs. you continuously cry inside why i purchased the ticket. please give me a refund.in today's world where the best movies and web series from around the world are upon the tip of your thumb, this movie fails to hide its weakness. the only factor driving the whole setup is srk, similar to pathan. the moment you take srk out and put another actor in, the movie falls.conclusion : srk is really a cinema god. only he is capable of driving such soul-less movies to the destination known as box office hits.", "it's actually a great movie which keeps you connected. good thriller movie which actually shows the dark side of our planet. this movie has no connection with the incident or with how rescue operation is carried out,dont expect some sensible it is a typical bhai kind of movie where everything is possible and others are helpless because tiger is still alive,the only saving grace is the action. so when you go to watch shahrukh khan movie you don't expect good acting or even a good script or a script at all. i don't really put my reviews but seriously they consider us as fools. these kind of movies are purely made to earn money, and now we should become smarter than them and not watch this.", "jawan is one of the best movie of king khan for me. it must be the biggest hit of atlee.character - most of the character picked up by family man web series. including priyamani, mehek, vijay sethupathi (farzi) and muthu (a tehsildar),sunil grover - as per my understanding one of the biggest role that he has received in his career as irani. what a look, the beard, dressing, shoes, dialogue delivery, action done by sunil bhai is outstanding. i love him so much.priyamani - priyamani was again done amazing dance with shahrukh khan. first was there in chennai express (1234). she must be fortunate by sharing a screen with king khan. her physic, voice, dance, and this time totally in action mode with rifle. it was a mind-blowing performance.vijay sethupathi - when i was watching his performance, i went to few 90's film and i remember the dashing role of my favourite danny denzongpa. the dialogue delivery, action, looks, expressions, timing was speechless and specially his south hindi accent was fabulous. big fan.sanya malhotra - she was excellent performer in jawan. starting from her first scene in the metro. she has done amazing role as doctor and a team player of vikram rathore team. she has also shown multiple types of action. i guess first time action and come out of comedy role, romantic movies etc.music - obviously, the music director is from chennai (south). hence it is expected that whole movie will have south indian music tadka. which was ultimate. loved it. even the background score is also out of box. the intro music for kali is outstanding. no doubt, the intro music for vikram and azad as well great.dance - very simple simple steps was added in all songs. which was awesome. always shot on joseph vijay's songs. loved it.songs - awesome song writing. even as usual so many background dancers have seen, especially in the zinda banda song.direction and writing - no doubt. it is fabulous. even the screenplay was also great and commendable. the farmer scene very well written. the duplicate rifle scene could have been better. imagine the scene where sealing of the company done by common people. the ungli scene and the message that vikram rathore has given all of us as a common people. very well written and shoot. the health dept scene was amazing.", "jawan may be shot mainly in hindi, but it is a tamil mass film in all its essence. atlee is known for basically copying ideas from other famous movies and making them in his own style for his favourite star. jawan is an amalgamation of many such movies, including his own films. but the core is the man against system idea which was popularized in this particular form by director shankar and since then it has been embraced by south indian movies. the first half had a few interesting stuff going on but it was kinda boring me. i've heard about how atlee dismisses normal logic from how people talk about his films like bigil which is even more apparent here. knowing this and being an srk fan, i was expecting stuff in the film that defies logic. overall it didn't affect me too much but the first half had a lot of such things that continuously happened that made it hard to enjoy it. not using logic to be entertained is fine but the film has too much story in it and most of it doesn't have any logic. it's following too many formula-driven story ideas at once without properly integrating them. but once the interval block action sequence started the movie turned around for me. from there onwards it was a very entertaining movie and if you can watch it with a great audience it will be a great experience.but it is to be noted that, there's so much story here, but no real characters. the characters are not at all written with depth but everyone is given certain visual flairs to make it very appealing. nayanthara's character felt so weak but the way she is presented visually through the action scenes kind of makes you forget that.some dialogues and scenes kind of felt like a personal message from srk which seamlessly blends with this kind of film. maybe that's why he wanted to do such a south-style film.all in all, i thought it was an average to okay film because i am an srk fan and enjoyed watching his action scenes and song sequences in the theatre.if die hard is a christmas movie, this is an onam movie", "jawan is a story of social awareness about issues currently in our country. it is also a story of a jawan who gets wronged in his own country then his son does all the things to give him father a jawan a honor and respect that he deserves. nice acting by the cast specially hero shah rukh khan and villain vijay sethupathi. nice acting by all the feamle leads, deepka padukone, nayanthara, sanya malhotra, ridhi dgra. the family man sereis season 1 most of the cast are in this movie. vijay sethupathi and other two female actors. nice message around election and votes given in thiss flm. this film is about patriotism and will also make you emotional. this film is about romance at the same time it is about family and society issues. nice movei with good package i would say of all the things i said above. nice music, songs and dance. challeya son and dance steps are huge hit. i recommend you to watch the story. you will find different looks of shah rukh khan in the movie. and in all thes looks he has performed really well. i really had a nice time watching this movie. i recommend jawan movie to you. i rate jawan movie 10 stars on 10. you would not find a reason to not like thi movie. last shah rukh khan one looks is there where he smokes too much cigarette. that using too much cigarette could be avoided as this is aa family film, they should have thought that even small children are watching this film. they shouldnt be inspired.", "the movie is made as an action-packed mass-masala entertainer to capture the interest of all movie-goers in india and i believe that the movie will achieve that due to the high relevance in today's political ecosystem. the movie isn't preachy but delivers some solid food for thought.the action sequences are very well made with srk's physique put to the test ( or i don't know if it's stunt doubles ), which was the highlight of the movie. each sequence makes you cheer for srk and that's done effortlessly! nayantara really surprised me with her action sequences and she had good chemistry with srk too.cinematography was peak and beautiful to watch in theatre and the person who did that, did his job really well!plot was mediocre though with atlee combining sequences, stories and shots of his previous movies like mersal and his usual formula making the lead actor play father and son with a predictable revenge story.anirudh's music for the movie didn't feel impactful but his background scores were superb which elevated the gravitas of srk in action sequences!overall, it's a great watch in theatres and it's a solid popcorn movie!", "srk is passionate about cinema and wants to take indian cinema ahead but looks like he is saddled with several people who are less passionate. how can one explain this slow motion tripe of a movie. why so much slow motion? because the cost is low and it serves as a tangent for low cost stunts and vfx. the only good and thrilling shots are of a metro careening at high speed in mumbai and mind you that is not in slow motion. there is no action set piece that is a wow, this is great. slow motion action is cheating the audience. i am sure srk wants to push his movies to mission impossible level but alas at the moment cannot do so. the next is the thin plot that has several plot holes. what about the violence? this movie is so violent that it would have been an automatic r rating in us if it had been a hollywood movie. with a star cast of more women than men, this would be a first but when you come to individual roles, none of the women have a meaty one including deepika padukone. sincerely wish, deepika comes back to piku days. what is she doing in this nonsense? finally the villain played by vijay is a caricature. he does not look at all menacing, in fact his right hand, murad is more threatening. it is hard to say which one was more mediocre, pathaan or jawan. srk needs a rajamouli to up indian cinema, wish that happens soon. 2 stars for srk's energy and passion!", "this film is 100% enjoyable, displaying srk and atlee's next-level work, as well as outstanding performances by vijay sethupathi and the whole ensemble.\"\"jawan\" is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the year! not when you just want to be silent! shah rukh khan demonstrates yet again why he is the king!story: keeps you interested throughout, the entire theatre went insane. despite being an action thriller, the film has a strong emotional core. it's unusual for a masala indian film to write well-developed female characters.finally, \"jawan\" is a must-see for action movie fans. you'll want to see more of this flick.", "grand opening, good 1st half, average 2nd half, meh climaxplus: srk's dual role, bgm, action, screenplayminus: cliche story & dialogue, songs, length, vijay as

cinematography.the problem with jawan is that in the second half the story is sacrificed in favour of 'massy' moments and the movie ultimately suffers due to this. the conclusion did not feel satisfying and the cameo appearance felt pointless.without spoiling anything in the second half, a character is introduced who states that there will be consequences if the antagonist fails. this character is not seen again and a major plot detail is skipped.the soundtrack of this film and the song chaleya are very good. unfortunately all other songs in the movie are absolutely crap and not worth a second listen. there are people out there who will blindly fanboy over anything and are rating these songs highly however they do not compare to other srk film albums like dilwale.this is an entertaining movie that highlights key issues the working class population face. the political messaging in this film is very strong however the difference between a good film and a great film is longevity. how it holds up against the test of time.unfortunately storytelling sacrifices are made in favour of subliminal political messaging resulting in an uneven film.7/10.", "\"jawan\" is an

lunch, dinner, and some delicious leftovers combined. this is the kind of cinema i have started appreciating more and more these days-great escapist, over-the-top masala entertainment that takes all

are watching jawan. there are flaws but it need to be ignored to make yourself entertained. srk charm will entertain you in all aspects. the rest of the characters are also in the same line. in some parts i too laughed. today i understood what entertainment really means. it means accepting the flaws and be unmindful. that's what these categories of movies intends to deliver. a well made movie in

oneself. thanks to writers & additionally director to present this masterpiece. the viewing experience was so intense that it bought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.direction, screenplay,

set pieces to justify the budget, and hoped shah rukh khan would save the movie. spoiler: he doesn't. the rave reviews just show how starved north india is of quality content, or how deluded the shah

imo) produced this uninspired garbage.the criminals shah rukh khan does his heists with are incredibly irritating, and only are written for a cheap 'girl power' message (bigil, anyone?) to boost its critical reviews.how srk picked this script is beyond me, i don't think this even qualifies as a vijay film in terms of dumb writing.", "srk makes sure to leave a mark as an actor even in a mass movie like jawan. bald cap, salt and pepper beard aren't enough to not be identified. his raspy old man voice actually completes the disguise. the voice is better and more effective than christian bale's batman voice in the dark knight trilogy, in my opinion. i would like to defend that vigillante motif. i don't think that the movie abandons it or nearly forgets about it. i see actually see it as a clever twist on vigilante / social justice films like those made by shankar. in those older movies, vigilantism, violence and god-like hero figure is needed to fix the society. jawan starts exactly like that and makes people feel satisfied that corrupt politicians are punished and justice is served but at the end it almost breaks the fourth wall and conveys a message that goes like \"hey folks, don't forget this is just a movie and we don't really need a hero like this because we have already enough power as a citizens of a democratic country\". also, unlike clearly leftist shankar's movies, jawan focuses solely on issues that have no right-wing or left-wing angles. and all of them are actually based on real events that happened (or even keep happening) in india. therefore, the politics of the movie is not partisan but it's also not vague and shy to address real issues. so, i think the vigilante motif is actually well-thought. at first, we think that srk's character is a baddie, then we are happy to see he's a good vigillante fighting injustices in indian society and finally, we are made to realize that we (or indians) as citizens should be the ones fixing all those problems by voting carefully.part of traditional tamil medicine or siddha vaidhiam, the use of checking the pulse is a form of diagnosis technique. if you watch older tamil films, specially based on life in villages and smaller towns, you can see this reference to this shown quite a lot. technically when someone is pregnant, the pulse rate will change compared to when you are not, and someone trained in using the technique was able to detect the variation that signified that someone was pregnant. maybe its scientifically not proven still that a doctor can predict if a woman is pregnant with her pulse, but a pregnant lady's pulse works much faster than a normal woman, the heart rate rises rapidly in order to keep her growing child healthy, most of the ancient indian/chinese traditions used this technique before.also, i really liked the tamil dub for azad especially in the whole metro sequence. he matched all of srk's delivery, grunts and expressions exactly!", "i don't know how jawaan is getting such good reviews, i felt like leaving the theatre midway in first half. the prisoners in jail look like models, a half-baked storyline, star casts like nayanthara and sanjay dutt are added just for the sake of adding big names but have no role to play, even we could have expected more from the villain. disappointing direction and music. most of the appealing visual elements of the movie is copied from somewhere. second half is bearable that too because of deepika's acting. she is the only person whose character development has been done well in short span and has done some serious acting.", "it's a blend of women empowerment with a male character support with some cringe scenes copied or extracted or inspired from many other south indian movies. bgm is repeated at many times.actors performed well. it's a commercial mass grade movie with expected story line but some interesting scenes.atlee must stop copying scenes from his previous movies. he is worth more than raja rani. his direction is getting degraded from one movie to the next movie.shah rukh khan - one man movie .without his charisma this movie would have been a flop at the box office. you can compare the collections in south india with north india. south collections were very low and can infer that it was a mixture of all other movies .", "we all know srk as a romantic star but he has done great performances also in movies which are not love stories namely, don,don 2, fan, raees, dear zindagi, duplicate and his recent movies pathan and now this jawan.jawan is full south indian type of mass action based film having a good story and great performances by shah rukh khan, vijay sethupatti, nayanthara, the girl gang and the others. anirudh's music again is a plus in this movie. atlee

watch any film that has a touch of patriotism without thinking, as if such films are the identity of your patriotism. bollywood and south makers have also understood this very well. after pathan gadar 2, now jawan is also a film of the same series. this time the director has served the audience a mix of south, north and hollywood, as some concepts have been taken from money heist and some from south films like thunuvi and old movies. whenever the film comes on the silver screen with south flavours it is entertaining and yes over too.young shahrukh khan part in movie is so dull and speed breaker for movie.this movie is for shahrukh khan so don't think director give chance to other characters.i am also disappoint to saw hat for shahrukh khan director aitlee waste vijay sethupathi but

and see ...!!!", "\"jawan\" is an action packed film that has all the ingredients to be a good piece of entertainment: impossible action scenes that are clearly made with a humoristic intent, complex and colorful choreographies and overall a good plot that kept me glued to the screen, despite its length. the story is pretty simple, but it has a couple of interesting plot twists that make it spicier. the stunts are amazingly done and i was truly surprised to see what atlee managed to pull out. there are some sequences that are ridiculously over the top. some editing techniques are overused, such as slow motion or speed ramps. i am aware of the fact that these are quite popular in indian blockbusters, but after a while they just become repetitive and they lose their effectiveness.some sections feel a bit overwhelming, as the director tried cramming too many things, with no particular logic. the film changes mood too quickly, not giving the time to transition between a happy and wholesome sequence and a dramatic moment. some scenes just do not match well together, and i feel that some important adjustments needed to be done, in order to make this production a bit more accessible. aside from this minor setback, if you are looking for some brainless entertainment, \"jawan\" might do the trick. my final rate is 7.5 out of 10.", "terrible film. complete waste of time. too many sub-plots that make the overall film incoherent. the film cannot decide what it is about - it has tried to be an action film as well as a romance film as well as a revenge film. it has used multiple filmstars in small, even unnecessary roles just to give the audience something to get excited about. the music is missable with no memorable numbers that you will find yourself humming later.if you are used to good cinema you will be thoroughly offended by this excuse of a film. if you have a taste for senseless, over the top, disjointed storytelling that commercial south indian cinema dishes out, you might enjoy it.", "belive me watching this movie your theatre will went on fire mode! the 2 hrs 50 mins jawan movie directed by atlee starring sharukh khan is a perfect top notch action mass movie for the indian audience. the direction and action of jawan are hollywood level,the cinematography and screenplay is like the audience is sitting on a roller coaster.despite having a long run time the movie will not feel lengthy or bored at any point of time because of its amazing twist and turns. for srk fans its a perfect treat for them! i will call this movie the best of king khan career. its a mass family entertainer and if you are reading this review then please don't hesitate a bit and go for it ,you will not regret watching this

realistic movie. so do not expect much.after second half, movie picks up but not what was expected.vijay as a villain should work more on hindi accent or dubbing could also be done.one thing i want to tell to the director that now india is shaping so just do not show the negative image of system which one can relate a decade ago.now things are improving.tamil director just tried to pull the actors from north and south which is a good initiative for cross culture and also a good for income.", "shah rukh khan's film 'jawan' has been praised for addressing social and political issues, including the importance of voting. the actor emphasized the need to vote intelligently and responsibly. the film highlights themes such as government apathy, corruption, farmers' suicides, and a failing healthcare system. it crossed the 500 crore mark in just four days, making it the fastest bollywood movie to do so. the film continued its success, earning 45 crores on its first monday. dr. eeram, who is one of the key characters in the film, is inspired by real-life events and individuals. dr. kafeel khan, who hails from gorakhpur, uttar pradesh, serves as the inspiration for this character.

moment was so epic and so supesions and every interesting and have epic meaning. overall stroy is fine not perfect from my opinion it was over action comedy has well scrpit actor they choose are so amazing and the timing of character the dialogue are great the bgm omg what bgm anirudh composed was so awesome overall the only thing i dont like songs and some poor stroy mens is fine but not perfect stroy so its movie where you can enjoy the you special time.", "just finished watching the movie. unimaginable! this is something else!first of all i would like to talk about that direction, the direction of atlee kumar is mindblowing secondly, i want to talk about the music, the music at outstanding, the background music gives me goosebumps!and i am so little to say about shahrukh khan i mean he's out of the world! indeed, this is his best film till now, you can never predict the story of this movie, the full of action full of thrilling there is a cameo of sanjay dutt, which is outstanding, he performs better than any other actor when it's come to cameo role!a must watch film not for indian but for the world!", "after watching this movie, i can confidently say, srk is the only person who can get the promised rs 15 lakhs in everyone's account. read on to know why i'm saying this.for masala movies they advise you to leave your brains at home. for jawan, put it in a locker at home and throw the key away..if you're looking for logic then you're in the wrong place. but if you're looking for entertainment then there's lots this movie offers.this is an out and out srk entertainer. everyone else, vijay setupathi, deepika padukone, nayanthara fall by the side.having said that, bigil was a disappointment and mersal was average. theri very much does have the vigilante mindset. if you've seen thala ajith movie aarambham, some of the vijay-atlee movies, the vijay movie, katthi, movies where the hero points out and fights the political system, then you may have a repeat with jawan.at worst, the film might be preachy. at best, it's the most authentic thing srk has done till date. this film gives a good message on the corrupt state of our country. there's some strong, repetitive but necessary social commentary. that's the film's strongest and most vulnerable part. and this is delivered by the one and only king khan.this movie holds up a mirror to the establishment and urges the audience to demand more from the people in power. srk breaks the fourth wall and speaks to his fans, through his art. there's nothing wrong in asking for excellence from your elected representatives regardless of their affiliations.the action choreography is of a very high calibre. songs by anirudh ravichander are average. the background music is an assault on the senses.if you feel like watching it, then go ahead. otherwise, go on with your life and let the fans enjoy an srk film.", "i can feel the angst of the critic- killing protagonist of chup, after watching this.i have come across so many reviews of this pertaining it to be the best action movie / biggest blockbuster/ film with relevant political messaging built in that i had expected the world.however, the film is shockingly mediocre, laughably ludicrous, devoid of logic with almost a half a dozen sleep inducing songs. it is worse than gadar 2, which suffered from a lack of execution although it had some claims to a storyline. it has relevant political messaging but the story around it is so convoluted that it is almost a gordian knot, to untangle.the first 45 minutes are actually the best. they are gripping and set up a tantalizing tale. however, as soon as this moves to inside a prison, it crashes and burns . it stretches credibility and becomes a parody of itself in the second half.nayantara, vijay setupati don't have much to do, except to swoon and snarl, respectively.shah rukh has mastered the art of generating an otherworldly buzz around his mediocre productions. once upon a time, he destroyed the indian film industry by selling romantic dreams. he is intent on doing the same via the action route now.one of the worst of this or any other year.", "i was expecting to be entertained by this film as i know every work of srk is a well done job. from storyline to pro acting of the cast to eye catching choreography to action, all done professionally and well. i have always loved and will love films produced and or acted by the legendary actor shahrukh khan. he knows his audience and respects their expectations in delivering a good film to them. i am sure he has many other upcoming great films under his sleeves to come! i am not just a big fan of him but a dedicated admirer and i look at him as my role model. from his humble start in indian film

teary multiple times i don't see the point of masala films.this could have been much better if not mass appealing if it had lesser songs and little lesser revenge factor and romance.it is good despite being a masala film. that is commendable. i enjoyed watching pathaan also. it has a more action oriented approach though.it is appreciable how a good social message was given. though whenever they said something about government it doesn't feel very powerful initially. could have improved there.just after watching the movie i liked pathaan better.though it's certainly worth a watch and a treat

vibration he has acted marvellously in all aspects like action ,romance ,humour, wickedness which will keep you in high spirits of entertainmentlet's not discuss about content as it's typical south indian types of high action and in super speed pace..songs were not at par..atlee has given one of his finest direction and took out the real heroism from srkthe movie should be watched in single screen with masses where you can enjoy dances ,whistle ,shouts which gives a pure masala movie feeling.", "i had high expectations from this movie. i have enjoyed the movie, but it had no great impact, not any goosebumps moments for me.i wish srk to be himself a bit more in the movie. he tried to act as professor from money heist, then rahul from chennai express, then any action hero from a south indian movie. srk being srk can pull off everything and he absolutely nailed his part but at the end, it was like a khichdi. i can just remember the entry of srk, after that i couldn't follow. till first half it was going good, second half was quite boring with many unnecessary scenes.this movie has tried to get everything, tried to grab the attention of audience with it's power packed actions, sudden romantic songs with his both co-stars, an unnecessary wedding, a predictable chor-police love story, 2-3 sentimental issues, social awareness, exploitations by businessmen and political leaders, double role by srk, vengeance, hostage, hijack, etc. etc.... i am still trying to figure out what was the main story.it is a 100% commercial movie without any proper story, aim is to earn maximum money, overhyped.just because srk is there, people are shouting so much but if you watch the movie being unbiased, it is a moderate film for me.", "the movie is entertaining but very very massy. larger than life storytelling , massy appeal , extreme emotions ,lack of logic and very fast pace and fast love stories too. it takes 2-5 mins for the girl to agree and say yes to the guy.rest the movie is very entertaining and the action of the movie is good , all the actors have done justice to their roles and the music as well as background music is also top notch.vijay sethupati's acting stands out amongst all and definitely it's srk's film all the way. one thing that could have been improved is a bit logic and realism in storytelling and the movie would have been even better but maybe it was made to be this way targetting the masses.it's a good one time watch and you'll enjoy it more if you keep logic and brains away :) .", "\"jawan\" starring the iconic actor

just re-treaded territory, first ignited by visionary mass director s. shankar, and now atlee, his former assistant director, who does his usual lazy shtick by simply rehashing the old stuff with overboiled, done-to-death, screamingly melodramatic direction - i badly wanted to exit the theatre at the 1.5 hour mark but forced myself to finish the nearly 3 hour punishment.it is painful to see storied superstar shah rukh khan degenerating so badly in the later decades of his career. this artiste who toplined such excellent movies as ddlj, dil se, devdas, asoka, swades has stopped caring about quality from a long time and only lusts after more box office triumphs no matter how shoddy his recent films are. notice he has long since stopped working with good directors and the few good ones he has recently worked with have been compromised by poor collaboration (imtiaz ali - 'jab harry met sejal').vijay sethupathi's acting deficiencies are severely exposed, while the performances across the board are mediocre. good taste and cinematic quality are repeatedly butchered in 'jawan' in the relentless hail of gunfire that drags on here - srk meanwhile has his champion sights firmly fixed on the rs.1000 crore box office mark. upnworld.", "jawan is a movie made to entertain and nothing else. those who are wanting to take it super seriously really shouldn't. i honestly missed these types of bollywood movies where it's just fun to watch with fun, memorable characters and great action scenes. there was never a boring moment in this movie despite the long runtime. the songs are all awesome and it was great direction from a south indian director as south indian movies are all the rage these days. atlee did a great job despite not having directed many movies before, especially one in hindi. now of course the great sharukh has to be mentioned. i just love sharukh's passion for any movie he is in, he gives it his all so he performed perfectly. you can tell he genuinely had fun doing this movie. the main actress (who was perfect for her role) and supporting characters all did a fantastic job. let all your worries go and just enjoy this movie, don't get too analytical. that's the best way to enjoy movies like this.", "the film for me as a huge srk fan was really disappointing because of the huge hype and the film didn't reach the hype given there are many drawbacks like huge length misplacement of songs completely nonsense moments which was all in my opinion really backed the film as a fellow who watched director atlee's recent film this film was also like a mixture of so many films i really knew about the similarities but this was too much the film was a little bit of this a little bit of that but some of them were fun to watch but overall the film was a below avg film for me(personal opinion) when taken to the positives there were some good moments especially the into it was really amazing which increased my hope but then it was just meh even anirudh also did avg compared to his recent works and the songs and the placement was really bad nayanthara vijay sethupathy did a good job nayanthara especially in the fights were awesome overall the fights the swag of srk are only the key factors of this film avg film 5.5/10.", "good thing we don't have to deal with reality while watching this movie. exaggeration kept increasing exponentially as the film moved on especially with the action scenes. there was shameless copying of the hollywood character bane from batman movie, which was downright embarrassing. if while watching the movie you get confused as to which shahrukh khan is the father and son. don't worry it's a confusion in all our minds. one with a slight makeup is the father, the other one with more digital touchup is the son. watching a 58 year old khan romancing does get awkward but not to worry he is still striking a pose and walking in slow motion. the main villain was decent in his role as he did not engage in overacting. padukone was good as she portrayed a mother aptly. sanjay dutt looked like a last minute addition so he didn't have much of an impact. not sure why a good actress like sanya malhotra

better storyline in terms of linearity and emotions.. songs are not melodious, maybe for die-hard fans, this may be considered a great music, but none of the songs are worthy.. fight sequences are good at times, but too many of them look senseless and worst still, the heroes never get shot at ... overall, its not a movie you remember after a week, it seems to be making a buzz in cinema

you to old bollywood where it fearlessly held up a mirror to the establishment and urged the audience to demand more from those in positions of power. srk during the 3rd act almost breaks the fourth

did a good work in presenting and exploiting srk's wow factor and swag. there are several wow factors in the movie like the multiple introduction scenes of srk and some action blocks. the interval block was total lit. the emotional scenes were the major negatives of the movie. it was boring and tiring.srk was the main attraction of jawan, the dad character steals the show in his entry was pretty good. nayanthara was charismatic in the first half but the screenspace in the second half was very rare. vijay sethupathi did a wonderful job as the main antagonist and delivers it with ease. all the supporting cast including priyamani, sania malhotra and deepika padukone did justice to their role.anirudh ravichander's solo debut was not so impressive. bgm in some parts especially srk intros was pretty good but whole in all it was a letdown. it failed to elevate some electrifying scenes and the emotional scenes were total boring. all songs were like tamil songs, and songs which he has used during sentimental scenes were too boring. he should adapt himself to improve in his hindi song compositions.positives srknayantharavijay sethupathiaction sceneschase scenesdance with huge

empowerment message). srk best performance till now. vijasethupathi is always best. nayanthara is looking cool. all the girls are on point with their performances. songs are also of massy level. stand out for anirudh because i am listning his music for movies since long time and i felt vikram was his peak level but he proved me wrong he has given his best music to jawan. atlee's direction is top notch in compare to his all previous movies. i recomend to watch it on big screen with your family,friends, girlfriends,boyfriends. pure goosebumbs with good story libe, twists, cinematography. go and watch it now.", "this is an action packed thriller with a larger than life hero who is not not only smart and daring but a master of disguises too. in this age of women empowerment all his assistants are women who have been wronged at some stage of their lives. it is basically an entertainer for the masses and has almost everything for family audiences. there are emotional angles too with father-son, husband- wife relationships in focus. it is shahrukh khan all the way with scenes guaranteed to thrill his fans and others. the movie seems to have been made on the pattern of south indian movies like kgf. the supporting actors are from south which is apparent from their accent. some issues which can be seen in the movie and a few societal wrongs with their suggested solutions. suicides of poor farmers, a corrupt political system, non implementation of welfare schemes, inferior weapons given to armed forces, polluting factories etc etc are a few of them.director atlee has made a pot boiler of all box office elements to ensure commercial success. logic and finesse can wait. he has ensured that audiences are kept absorbed through a clever mix of action, drama, dances, humour and music. even the seriously built up climax is laced with humour. as mentioned earlier it is a bonanza for fans of shahrukh and entertainment hungry masses as he goes about handing out justice in all areas of society even though the means are questionable. towards the end we get a hint that the next mission planned is to get back the black money stashed away in swiss banks. can't wait to see it.", "jawan - shah rukh khan's high-octane action thriller.review by m. sirajshah rukh khan's jawan was the most anticipated film in indian cinema directed by atlee, the second hit followed by pathan for srk within 6 months' time, atlee as a director put his foot stalwartly in bollywood, fascinated the audience with his first and most exciting paka hindi commercial debut film which received a lot of attention for the fact that, when we heard that bollywood badshah shah rukh khan is playing the lead in atlee's film, every audience expected what jawan will be, and that's exactly what atlee has given them. jawan, told by atlee in his style of vengeance story which has been seen many times by the audience in many ways, but atlee style with songs, stylish dances, love, affection for our country, emotional moments, vogueish action scenes, eye-catching colourful scenes and stunning canvas made the film inimitable. shah rukh khan plays dual roles, vikram a soldier and azad as a robin hood in disguise whose main job is to robe the rich to help the poor, atlee, clearly gives a strong political message, touched exclusively some social issues, including corruption, farmer suicide, even he conveyed the true fact of dr. kafil khan's subject in a reverberating manner with a female character. atlee has made the film with the audience in mind who has given priority to the general audience and has a clear sense of what they expect from him and delivered exactly what to do to get them thrilled for whistling goosebump moments.jawan is a very engaging film; he has done an exciting expression of a commercial storyline without allowing the audience to think too much for a single moment. written with shah rukh khan fans in mind, he precisely merged all the elements for a mass entertainer, whereas he has overcome the minor shortcomings of the script with the excellence of its visual language, starting from the introduction of srk. he not only made the audience laugh, but he minted some emotional scenes also, shah rukh khan's performance was very stylish and his looks, expressions and dialogue style were used in a very good way with some highlight's combination and emotional moments in an appealing manner. while the director succeeded in connecting the characters emotionally with the audience in the first half, in the second half, audience may not bother for the logic, srk and atlee wrapped the audience without even giving them time to breath. shah rukh khan with his pretty gym fitness, was able to capture the audience in a very rousing way and thereby move them along with the film. even at this age, shah rukh khan's energy and impact on the screen with his looks, body language and mannerisms are miraculous. vijay sethupathi a never before type of villain enhanced his role seamlessly, took the audience by surprise with his easy-going acting style as usual, nayanthara was seen for the first time in the film validating her nickname lady superstar with her action scenes as well as a lovely mother of a child. the visuals were gorgeous while the songs composed by anirudh, the darling of south indian music, drudged well to refresh the audience with energy and enthusiasm. his contribution to the film worth to be mentioned, whereas the editing is at its best to keep the two-hour film moves at a rapid pace. we can say without a doubt that jawan is a perfect mind-blowing entertainer to be experienced only in theatre.great work by director atlee who presented srk in a superb manner how the audience wants to see him in the big screen and srk again proved he is the king khan.review by m. siraj.", "the characters are all over the place, the plot is wafer thin and the hype around the movie is so loud that it has drowned all those real voices that are tearing their hair apart.riding purely on the status appeal of srk, the movie tries to build on 90s theme. not sure what was the director athlee trying to achieve but this might end up his weakest movie in the last few years.great actors like vijay sethupathy and nayantara is totally wasted. sanya malhotra becomes a side kick when she is currently doing lead roles and the songs are the worst from any srk movie. it sounds like a reverse dub of south songs being literally translated to hindi.adults and kids slept through the movie as it become a hachet job by srk and he started hamming badly in the second half. after the high of pathan, this takes him backwards and he ends up doing crappy movies.", "the message shown in this movie is indeed great and brings to light many issues faced in our country. srk & vijay sethupathi have totally owned the movie by giving the best to their characters. srk has given one of his best performances in this film with his double role which shows how versatile of an actor he is. the way each character has been portrayed dynamically is indeed very creative of the filmmakers.the twists in the story are amazing and everyone should watch it. it was far better than i had expected and totally worth the time and money.ps: the music in the movie was also great..", "this movie had everything shah rukh khan fans wanted to see. his entrance to his famous metro scenes to his dialogues and action, everything was super cool. i did not like the side actors in his team members and wife. they acted horribly. but shahrukh khan alone carries the movie all the way through on his shoulders. the surprise entrance by some other big actors helped our thirst to see some other great performances with sharukh. the lesson in the movie was solid. i don't know if the movie really needed imax. i would give it a 7 because of horrible actors by side actors (women team members and negotiating woman police officer) that kept spoiling the scenes for me.", "only good thing about this movie, stolen scenes from other movies and added together. a complete disappointment from atlee. never imagine atlee will make such a disaster.never expected much from s r k, he always copied legends. atleast john abraham gave some backbone to pathaan. anyone watching international movies can get bored right from the opening scene.n a y a n t a r a did some good acting.6 girls input is phenomenal.o v e r a l l, the movie had potential of some good plot, but a t l e e completely blown it away.complete waste of time and m o n e y. a b s u r d songs with no link to story line.", "is it worth watching in the theatre? my opinion: yes it is.if you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, you might want to check out this one. it is a thrilling and action-packed ride that does not shy away from tackling some of the political issues that plague our society. the first half of the movie is especially well-crafted, with brilliant direction and performance from the cast. the movie has its flaws, such as some plot holes and clichéd bollywood drama, but they do not overshadow the overall entertainment value. the movie also surprises you with some unexpected twists and a powerful background score. it is a bold and open-minded movie that dares to speak the truth that everyone knows but no one talks about. i would recommend watching it in the theatre to enjoy the full experience.", "this movie is mass masala entertaining movie, with the collaboration of bollywood and south indian makers.2 story runs in a parallel, one story belongs to vikram rathore (srk sir) and the other belongs to our loop holes of our country i.e on the public facilities provided by our government.srk & vijay sir did a superb acting.background music by anirudh brother was also very well.director of this movie atlee did a great work.--- there was a news that vijay joseph will appear in this movie, but that was rumours. i had waited till the last scene in the hope that vijay sir will come but.....", "one word review greatest film of 2023, an outstanding story that the showed us, this is actual reality that we faced on each day of our life, politicians are playing with our minds , and farmers are dying, no facilities in government hospitals, each and everything, even richest billionaire have no problem regarding this, read full review, when you started watching this film trust me you can't control your emotions maybe tears on it's way, and background score is incredible may your goosebumps distract you but it's just amazing, and songs are average,but challeya is good..this film is all about bribes, political, innocents people suffering from daily problems and pollutions, each and every characters do their best no over acting no lame jokes and action is on the next level hollywood style and south hindi mixed action, double roles also makes you happy and vijay sethupathy humorous jokes make you laugh harder , and nayanthara acting is somewhat mind blowing she plays her role very well and come to the direction atlee is the best director that is why this film become all time blockbuster, that's the genuine review , shahrukh khan and vijay and nayanthara played an anonymous roles in their characters no doubt this movie will gonna wins several awards maybe including oscar and already won audience hearts this movie may make you cry badly so watch without any interruptions and also they give unique cameo in the end so watch till the end without skips and salute to atlee kumar direction he has unique skills overall greatest movie this film deserve 10 out of believe me you'll watch this movie same day after you done, because the storyline is not boring and also good for the kids..", "atlee much like his master director shankar who made hindustani/ nayak/aparichit is known to make movies that question the system. either a vigilante fighting criminals or an underdog who fights the capitalists.although bigil was disappointing and mersal was average, theri very much exposes his vigilante mindset.in jawan, he mixed up all his usual plots put it out on a typical template format he uses for his vijay films but on a bigger canvas, better visuals and stunts and quick paced edit in what manifests not just a love letter to srk but a celebration of action masala films.this is perhaps the most wholesome entertainer hindi film industry had in almost a decade. reminds us of the industry that gave action flicks like sholay.atlee did infact packaged in his usual format and with the cast and crew it does feel like a tamil masala film but with a charismatic shahrukh khan in the lead.anirudh's songs were a hit and miss with some entertaining and some just below average. but the background score was phenomenal- anirudh excels in his usual game- elevates the action set pieces to a much higher level.action choreography and cinematography was spot on- stunning visuals and well coordinated fights keep you engaged.atlee wins on his hindi directional debut - like a king, with the king.", "srk in an action avatar is somewhat underwhelming to watch. nayanthara's hindi debut was lackluster. vijay sethupathi, well, let's just say he's not living up to the hype. a message to society, but who really cares? the runtime felt never-ending, and there was not a single moment worth mentioning. watching it in a theater, especially a single screen, only amplifies the disappointment with the constant noise.atlee sir as a director barely managed to salvage the story and star cast. like all his previous movies, this one also attempts a feeble social message.pre-interval, srk's entry, and the climax were just ordinary, nothing exceptional.and the so-called soul of this movie, the bgm, falls flat. anirudh's music couldn't save this mass movie from being a complete letdown.", "\"jawan,\" featuring bollywood icon shahrukh khan and a star-studded lineup of south indian cinema's finest, serves up a bollywood spectacle that's sure to tickle the taste buds of entertainment seekers. with its latest, heart-pounding action sequences and a generous sprinkling of patriotism, the film manages to keep viewers thoroughly engaged.notably, vijay sethupathi's portrayal of the antagonist bears a striking resemblance to the unforgettable antagonists brought to life by prakash raj in the past. his performance adds depth and intensity to the movie's overall narrative.shahrukh khan leads the way with a commendable performance, and the ensemble cast of actresses complements the storyline with their solid acting chops. while the acting is good, it hovers just above the average mark.storywise, \"jawan\" borrows elements from various bollywood movies and draws inspiration from the popular \"money heist\" series, creating a familiar yet engaging narrative. however, it falls short of making a profound impact on the audience.for those seeking a classic bollywood masala experience with the latest in action-packed stunts, \"jawan\" delivers a satisfying 4/5 rating. but, when scrutinizing the film for its storytelling, acting, and overall resonance, it comfortably settles at a respectable 3/5.", "the storyline covers topics on poverty and patriotism that involve issues like corruption, social issues, and money heists. it seems to have been a common topic or plot in most bollywood movies over these years!the pace is alright to have actions everywhere. but the first half is apparently much better than the 2nd half. in fact, it gets boring in the latter stage.shah rukh khan is still charming, playing most of the big actions. however, this movie over focuses on shah rukh khan that it doesn't give any screentime to other actors or actresses! after the movie, you could hardly remember anyone, except shah rukh khan!in terms of action, this movie has nothing new, big, interesting, or exciting to offer! the action scenes are like any other bollywood action movies that we have watched many times! in comparison, i would prefer the actions + setting of pathaan (another shah rukh khan's movie) more than this x 100!!!as usual, there is singing + dancing in all indian movies. however, the soundtracks + dances are not engaging and involving enough to gel me into the flow, compared to other indian movies, which i enjoy very much!the movie is rather long and draggy at times. also, the storyline is a bit one-dimensional! although there is a small twist to having a side-story about shah rukh khan's father, it's not superficial enough to wow audiences. also, the villain is not developed enough to carry the movie to the end!personally, i found it a forgettable movie! because there is really nothing impressive + big that lingers in my mind, after stepping out of the cinema. the father-and-son relationship is pretty touch-n-go, without much emotional or engaging moment. overall, it's just another bollywood action movie, and that's all!", "i just wasted approx 3 hours of my life for this crap. this crap is senseless and a torture to anyone . shahrukh khan, please use some logic before releasing a torture cell. do not waste your time and money . acting by each and everyone in the movie is pathetic. srk disappointed me a lot . i am a huge fan of him but he is a total waste in this movie.direction from atlee is too bad. i think he was confused while making this movie and did not know what to do. as a srk fan, i am very disappointed in him that he is wasting his talent like this. blind shahrukh fans won't find my review helpful, though.", "this movie is atlee's movie supported by anirudh's background music!it's massy, it's amazing! especially for a bollywood movie and for shah rukh khan.pathaan was good, but this is better!especially the interval is just pure goosebumps!to get to watch an actual bollywood movie like this with all talents working hard to give good contents and not just repeated or copied works, is such a great feeling.but for those who have watched south indian films, would know that this is just another great movie.there were plotholes and places where you have to just accept it without applying logic (and no, i am not talking of action scenes). i have seen better ones, especially if atlee's. but this doesn't reduce the quality of this film.", "never saw a house full 7 am show, we woke up so early to see srk's jawaan and it was so amazing.. best way to start the day.. a second watch is must.. ek baar se dil nahi maanega..this movie will definitely break all the records that has been made so far in bollywood this year.. we have seen lot's of good movies this year.. but this one has become my favorite..it's always a good feeling to see your favorite actors movie on it's release day and of course the first show of the day.. you get to see the die heart fans out there in theaters and to see people cheering and wristleblowing on srk's entry scenes was mind-boggling.", "the core message in this movie broke the fourth wall and struck a universal message to the audience - if one is fortunate enough to live in a democracy, or a place where your voice and opinion counts, then go vote, go lead, and go make an impact out in the world in person. i found it rather clever to reveal this message through a modern retelling of robin hood (stealing/hoodwinking those in power and giving to the citizens in need). if i had one criticism, it would be that the plot jumps around a bit between different points of view and flashbacks/modern day. despite enjoying all the content and story, i found it ultimately distracted from the heart of the story at times. that being said, i'm still thinking about this movie, it's message, and the way it's galvanized me to pay a bit more attention to all that's happening around me on both a local and international scale; as well as what role and impact i can make on my community. despite the patchwork of stories, the sheer charm and performance delivery of srk's characters had me on the edge of my seat, rooting for the heroes at the end. left the theater unable to wipe the smile off my face.", "it's not a bad movie at all , definitely an improvement from srk's last film. however, it has its flaws - some unintentionally funny moments, and certain songs felt out of place. the backstory of the six girls is intriguing but rushed, making it hard to connect despite the nearly three-hour runtime. srk delivers, especially in emotional scenes, but his stylized approach in commercial films may not resonate with everyone. vinay sethupati's role falls short of expectations, the character seeming weak. the shining performances, though, come from the six girls. anirudh's music, excluding \"chaleya,\" isn't impressive, but the background score is outstanding. atlee's direction is good, but the screenplay could've been more refined. final verdict: jawan's plot is promising, execution falls short; i'd rate it 6.5 out of 10.", "too much of paid promotion for the srk film, i was expecting atleast something new but the film has used the plots of 1980s films. aakhiri rasta is one of the films it has heavily borrowed from. srk is overacting as usual. this is where bollywood fails, nothing new to offer and audience watch movies just for their superstars. plot should be the king but it's not the case for bollywood fans. i got bored before interval and forced myself not to sleep during the movie. somehow i reached the climax convincing myself that there would be a cool climax waiting. nothing happened and i regret going to the movie. bottom-line is it's a cliche story, same old direction, same old srk acting which he is repeating for 30 years. nothing great.", "jawan- a heavy dose of social message conveyed in a succinct and powerful manner.it's out and out king khan's movie with full feast to his fans. been ages since i saw his real depth in acting (like in baazigar, darr and chak de), but glad to see king khan is back with full bang.this movie showcases his true heroism that only atlee could bring out. from action sequences, signature style, anger, emotions, cool demeanor with a surprise package at the interval- srk shines big and displays his stardom with a whack!atlee hits key social points with a strong plot throughout, creatively crafting and connecting current issues that many common person can relate to.screenplay is crazy quick and zooms past like a tesla plaid s.vijay sethupathi is simply amazing, and displays his spectacular talent in the most wicked and funny way.nayan taara's swag and fight sequences are clap worthy. rest of the cast has supported well.jawan will surely create box office records and the money will clock like a dhamaka!", "jawan is a welcome pivot in the genre of large-scale actioners that have been reviving bollywood lately. the film is aware of the responsibility it has of showcasing the biggest star of the moment while delivering a point with the kind of bluntness that might make many amongst the audience that this name attracts flinch - at least in the first half.the film carries star-referencing along with a touch of realism as well as it carries drama along with action. srk manoeuvres the film to the best of his versatile abilities, often getting boosted by atlee's fancam moments - which telugu and tamil grammar of cinema do best. this grammar also beautifully enhances the poetic delivery of the origins of a few in the supporting cast. sadly, there wasn't enough time to get to all of them like we did in money heist. the screenplay, however, doesn't always get the same attention from atlee. song sequences mostly felt like unwanted interruptions.now it's not as if one expects too much nuance or lack of plot conveniences/armours from a mainstream movie but there was space to fill some of the logical gaps. the movie, which revolts against some very true incidents of the last few years, just seeks to inspire a positive conversation around populism without getting so direct that it starts attracting political attack. its not as measured when it comes to delivering a statement from the star himself, though. in fact, its want for that made them spoil what could've been an actually surprising major plot twist in the trailer itself. grabbing the last-laugh headlines took the frontseat.the rest of the cast does a fantastic job with what they are given as well. sethupathy does what one expects from him in his comfort zone. nayanthara has a brilliant screen presence. sanya malhotra and priyamani are simply fantastic. deepika is charming in her extended cameo.zoya akhtar had said in an interview a while ago that in the post-pandemic world where platforms are wanting creators to do \"safe subjects\" and anything you say is getting censored, you deal with it by getting subversive. i probably wouldn't have put jawan in that category before the pandemic but today it lies amongst such tongue-tied mainstream attempts - including his own pathaan from earlier this year - that it just makes it past the antiestiblishmentalist cutoff. shah rukh khan is batting in his best form at the moment. that alone is reason enough to watch this film!", "i saw this first day last show in a suburban theatre with my entire family and extended family.the experience was phenomenal. the whistling, the shouting n cheering was epic.sharukh gave a commendable performance n the lead actress is a total eye candy.every public servant, politician and voluntary sector worker should be expected to watch this film. a lot of it is not easy viewing (the farmers n kids' plight) but the message it gives about today's society is compelling.in fact it shud be compulsory viewing for all high school students cos they r the future fellas who's gonna vote.as far for the film it is a masterpiece from my point of view. it shows you just how corrupt the medical system is and how the poor farmers are suffering.a good part of the blame is on the damn politicians. it is also another reason why it is so important to go and to vote in the upcoming elections .at worst the film might be preachy or sentimental, but at best it is the most authentic thing srk has done since my name is khan.when the press n voters bows down to the authorities, the authorities will mistreat the citizens.", "even though it had a few lags and issues in terms of storyline, it was still a mass, entertaining commercial film! and that's what atlee is good at since bigil, mersal and theri. and he delivered it really well on the screen. srk as always killed it with the \"roles\" he played and all the women as well killed it! everyone did they jobs really well and vijay sethupathi was a great villain on screen, even though he doesn't appear as often. the action was top notch as always with mass films. the music by anirudh ravichander was amazing as always from him and never disappointed anyone, from zinda banda to chaleya to the background music! overall, this was a must watch at the cinemas for anyone anywhere.", "srk, srk, srk!!!! my hero, my star, my world! i love you srk sir! loved loved loved you in jawan totally!! you killed it as both father and son! so hot and handsome!!!vijay sethupathi sir was just amazing as always!!! he's the best villain! his scenes with srk set the screens on fire!nayanthara ma'am, her chemistry with srk was just beautiful and lovely! she looked so beautiful and loved her in the action scenes! such a fantastic actress!music and bgm were just amazing!! anirudh sir, killing it as always! loved each and every song, the bgm gave me goosebumps!atlee anna, indebted to you forever!! thank you for showcasing srk sir in the best massy avatar ever on screen!go and watch jawan in theatres only!! don't miss it!", "why is this movie like 3 hours long ? atlee the director from south has nicely copied 10 different movies and merged it into one. being shankar director assistant also raising that issue. so it went from a heist to revenge to love to political. director lost his screenplay along the way. srk is way too old to be doing these roles let alone father and son as it looked more like brothers. nayanthara walks around with a gun 80% of her scenes with no emotion and there for the songs. deepika and priyamani roles were by far better then the half-baked role nayan got. one time watchable. it's on netflix so take your time with it . a movie good for background noise.", "after a tiring/ frustrating week .. i went to watch jawan hoping for some entertainment! and what a disappointment ! it is an extension of the southindian movie marsal by same atlee, which was great however jawan is bollywood packaging of same plot with srk who just doesn't fit the bill! only nayanthara is the saving grace..srk tries to projects himself like rajnikant but fails terribly to my liking.. i don't know how the reviewers said this is a superhit movie!.. i have a headache after watching this! can be easily skipped to save time and money! now i think pathaan was much better than this. atlee, you can do much better than this. srk, take a pause for a cause, and think before you act! we all should think, what we watch and most importantly what to promote.", "jawan is a stylish action thriller that features a star-studded cast, including shah rukh khan, nayanthara, and vijay sethupathi. srk is in top form, as he delivers a powerful performance as a secret agent on a mission to save the world. the action sequences are well-choreographed and exciting, and the story is engaging and suspenseful. however, the film does suffer from some pacing issues, and the ending is a bit predictable.here are some specific things i liked about the movie:* srk's performance: he is clearly in great shape and he brings a lot of energy and intensity to the role. he also has great chemistry with nayanthara.* the action sequences: they are well-choreographed and exciting, and they really showcase srk's skills as an action star.* the visuals: the film is beautifully shot, and the action sequences are particularly impressive.here are some things i didn't like about the movie:* the pacing: the film can be slow at times, and it takes a while for the story to get going.* the ending: it is a bit predictable and anticlimactic.overall, i enjoyed jawan and i would recommend it to fans of srk and the action genre. it is a stylish and exciting film with some great performances. however, the pacing issues and the predictable ending hold it back from being a truly great film.", "i am not a professional reviewer so will write from a very basic point of view. the movie is all about srk and the charm and style he brings. though this could have been much better if the revenge which is the base of the story would have remained with main vilain klaki but film ends giving giving message on environment and politics and vote and not sure what else...from acting perspective srk is srk specially the dad srk roles has suited better..rest of the actors has done well with what ever part given to them. to me the best actor if the movie is vijay setupati, he is exceptional. if some body really needs to understand his classs then watch farzi, 96, vikram vedha.", "the film delivers a really strong social message about issues like the corrupt political system, challenges faced by farmers, and flaws in the healthcare system.srk is being shown similar to super stars of south indian movies and it is a quite refreshing flavour to experience as srk fan.overall, jawan is an entertaining action drama that dares to make a statement about the social issues plaguing india. it is a film that showcases shah rukh khan's star power and atlee's directorial skills. it is a film that will appeal to the masses and the classes alike. it is a film that deserves more watch. i would rate it 10 out of 10 stars.", "jawan is not a film but it the mirror to the society. atlee kumar shows that why he is one of the best director in india. after theri, bigil and mersal, he is back with another blockbuster. direction, story, screenplay and dialogues are at the top notch of the aspects of the film. cinematography has been perfectly mastered. action sequences are designed creatively and seems to be original. acting performance by srk is soul of the film. without srk, the film would be incomplete. even the girls in the team of srk are the main pillars of movie. they have handled the main stream of lead actor. music by anirudh is just heaven. he has put his whole soul to create music of jawan. both songs and bgm are best thing in film. this film is must watchable film. you can watch it many times till your wish is accomplished.", "jawan is an amazing movie that i highly recommend. it is a well-made commercial entertainer that has all the elements to please the audience. shah rukh khan delivers a powerful performance in both his roles, and he is ably supported by a strong cast. atlee's direction is top-notch, and he keeps the audience engaged throughout the film with his fast-paced narrative and stylish action sequences. the film's cinematography and music are also excellent.in addition to being an entertaining film, jawan also deals with many important social issues, such as farmers' suicide, corruption, anti-environment industrialists, and unlawful arms dealings. the film does a good job of raising awareness of these issues and showing how they can impact people's lives.", "the story: the movie has a unique storyline with a group of... let's say sort of bandits taking action for the greater good being the nobel classic character of robin hood. just make them strong-armed with your typical heads of a group. like a hacker, a leader, an actor, etc.pros:the action sequencesthey are quite new and never before seen if not more than the story demanded. but, let's be real, you are going to a high-budgeted shar rukh khan action movie with multiple sponsors, of course, you'll see those unreal action sequences.the plotthe actual plot is favored by me since i'm a feminist like most people. if you believe in women'm empowerment, then you'll definitely like a big chunk of the film. the director certainly knew how to capture the emotions of us there.cons:the length: god, did the movie need a better editing team like yesterday! this is the biggest disadvantage of the long 3-hour movie. at least, 30 minutes of it could've been easily edited out without affecting the story.so many emotions: typical hindi movies tend to include all the genres and give us a mix of comedy, action, social cause, songs, etc. but, jawan relied heavily on emotional backstories in one scene and some minutes of comedy in another.yes, there's nothing wrong about showing the real sad life of people but i just don't want to cry every 20 minutes with a flashback.", "i was back in my teens! solid old-style entertainer, the types i grew up with amitabh bachchan and all that in 70s and 80s. it has dollops of contemporary social messages, social sentiments and over-the-top action. practically shahrukhs answer to modi & co about the last 10 years (because we used to have many such political films before 2014, but they vanished after 2014). my problems (deducted 0.5) were the unnecessary songs, that affected the superb speed of the movie, and the ending, where the villain was (admittedly) waiting for the sentiments to be done with. like the famous dialogue in good, bad and the ugly said, \"when you shoot, shoot. don't talk\".", "i had high hopes for this movie as so many amazing people are part of this movie. atlee, the famous tamil movie director, vijay sethupati, the og actor from kollywood, the music by my favourite music director, anirudh and the movie starring the most loved indian actor, shah rukh khan. i was sure about the massness and the art level of this movie as it is produced by red chillis, and it did make wonders. the movie starts with a bang, by the time you reach the interval, you will be overwhelmed by so many emotional, action and interesting sequences. the second half was comparatively weak as there were many goofs and you want more from the movie just as the first half. but still, it keeps you glued to the seat and srk creates a wonder on screen by his charisma.", "i will never get back my 3 hrs of life back. a very boring and over the top preaching movie with weak character development and very senseless action set pieces. apart from discussing social issues of india there was nothing in the movie. for 3 hrs the movie couldn't develop one proper character. i personally didn't like the songs but it may be down to personal preference. only redeeming quality was great background music and good cinematography in parts. i would have enjoyed it if it was 1 hr short probably. vijay sethupati was not scary enough. all female stars in the movie was shown very powerful which again should be discussed or developed in these 3 hrs of meaningless action sequences. another average bollywood flick.", "this is one heck of a movie with mass goosebump moments for the legendary actor shah rukh khan. i don't think even bollywood director would have thought of such moments for the king. the screenplay is racy, enough pauses are there for emotions and mind blowing action scenes and high moments.you never get bored at anytime, with anirudh's terrific background score and songs. the screenplay is good and interestingly the heroine has a part to play in this action thriller.the comic moments works great time. every getup is done with great attention to detail. kudos to the makeup and vfx team. must watch!!!", "if you're in the mood for an exciting and enjoyable experience, i highly recommend catching jawan at a nearby cinema. this movie is an excellent example of a well-crafted blockbuster that was made with utmost sincerity in all aspects. the series of thrilling events will keep you on the edge of your seat. when you visit theaters for hollywood superhero movies or spy thrillers like james bond or mission impossible, you know what to expect. however, if you're looking for a more contemplative movie, you might want to check out another option on an ott platform.the movie's director has a clear vision of preserving indian emotions while telling the story. shah rukh khan portrays stylized characters with good, bad, and ugly traits in this fast-paced film. the background music and songs contribute to the effective indian way of storytelling, which i believe is another art form that may or may not appeal to western audiences. i understand some critics and intellectuals prefer a certain type of movie. indian movies suffered in the last decade by attempting to duplicate western storytelling styles. this movie unapologetically embraces its commercial approach. if you're looking for a good time at the theatre with your family and friends, go watch it. you won't regret it!", "don't miss it ,there is an action,drama, emotions,comedy more important why your vote is too important portraited very beautifully.. tight screenplay, spectacular visuals most importantly anirudh bgm is another knock.vijay sethupathi as antagonist perfectly played,all other cast nayanthara ,priyamani,sanya malhotra,sunil grover,sunjay dutt everyone performed very well.and dipika and srk touch your heart..this movie about different people different emotions,how they treated badly in society, atlee potryed very very amazingly.. this movie touches everyone heart.. don't miss it.vote for the best..grab your ticket.", "the giants of bollywood haven't had great outings for their movies which were released in the last few years. srk did manage to get a long overdue blockbuster with pathaan early this year but the 'spy universe' promotion and 'bhai' appearance had a lot to do with it. i personally didn't like pathaan as much but i was definitely excited for jawan looking at its prevue and posters. i haven't been a great fan of atlee movies except for the mass moments but the concept of srk working with a south indian director excited me considering srk is one of the few actors in bollywood who can produce epic mass moments.jawan starts off brilliantly with a very good introduction to srk in terms of visuals and background score. the movie then goes to introduce different characters and their backstories along with the main plot (or it makes you think so). the movie is exceptionally fast paced until the interval block and is enjoyable despite most of us trying to make a sense of it. there is a very good interval block which does remind of many south indian mass movies. post interval, the movie turns into a chaotic ride and editing is not up to the mark at times. it is kind of hard to figure out what is the actual plot and the intention of the lead character(s). the main flashback episode has multiple layers to it and it goes too fast to be comprehended. the rivalry with the antagonist doesn't seem convincing enough as we get towards the climax. i personally felt there was one major character arc and flashback episode which could have been utilized much better but they end up showing those parts too fast. the songs are pretty good and also shortened in the movie but they do feel out of place in this fast paced action movie. comedy is very organic and also works better for the ones who would understand srk's style of wit. action sequences are done well (not too over the top) and the movie has many close up shots. anirudh shines again with his background score but the jaw dropping king khan rap from raja kumari isn't used enough for effect. when the movie ends it feels like you have watched 4-5 different movies. despite all the flaws the movie does keep its fun element intact and provides us with some of the best srk moments after years.shah rukh khan not only runs the show, but is the show. he is not only in the driver's seat but he is the engine of this movie. you can clearly see that certain over the top scenes/dialogues work because of his charm and not many actors could pull that off. this is one of his best performances in recent times. the movie does boast of some great supporting cast but the main ones nayantara and vijay sethupathi do not really make a huge impact. sethupathi as antagonist gives his best but his character offers nothing new or exciting. priya mani and ridhi dogra play short but significant characters and they fit very well into their roles. deepika and srk bring the 2007 om shanti om vibes back at times and it is surprising to see them look almost the same 15 years after. there is not much to say about the rest of the supporting cast as the movie keeps moving on too quickly.jawan is a chaotic celebration of srk's charm meeting the south indian masala way of filmmaking. throw the logic out of the window just how srk does with the goons and enjoy in theatres with the people of same energy around you.", "shahrukh khan again proved why is called the greatest acting superstar of indian cinema. this film has every aspect that commercial film need. full of emotion,action,romance,drama,thriller, suspense,massy elevation and so on. though the screenplay is quite fast but engaging. the concept of the film is praiseworthy. a lot of social message and women empowerment elements make this film more delightful. deepika cameo was more impactful for the movie and she justified her role brilliantly. director atlee deserves a full of standing ovations for making this film a top notch mass masala entertainment. and vijay,nayanthara also did a good job.", "if you remember the masala movies that amitabh bachan acted in the 90s , then jawan is a mould of those films.srk looks and acts terrific. credit must be given to his attempts to reinvent himself. it is a better movie compared to pathaan but still if you are expecting a movie like mission impossible or even the recent south hits like pushpa or vikra. , then you may he disappointed.i do think that srk is moving in the right direction chosing movies that can show his versatility rather than being stuck with karan johars movies in his prime i was a fan of amitabh bachans aura and srk is close to matching that in jawan. i just hope that someone like rajamouli makes a movie that showcases srks talent before it is too late.the women actors have a small role but impactful. nayanthara and deepika are good but this is a srk film and so everyone else is reduced to a supporting role. vijay sethupati is awesome in his limited screen presence. we hope to see more of him. the storyline is good but there are some scenes which don't make sense this is more a akhree rasta or a shahenshah style movie than a mission impossible. attlee has done better than any other director in presenting srk in an action role. so take a popcorn and drink and enjoy srks charisma as you don't know if and when someone will give a movie which challenges mission impossible type blockbuster with srk.", "srk's jawan will be a mega blockbuster...what is not here- 1. a good script 2. massy action 3. romance 4.comedy 5.social messageswhat a directography by atlee sir... and srk's entry scene with anirudh's bgm gives goosebumps.... and many more scenes the chase scene, train scene , interval, climax all are too good .... indian film industry needs more this type of massy film with good stories.. after a long time we see such a good movie.. 'just worth it' srk the king returns to reign the world again...my personal review is 10/10 #jawan will make history in indian cinema..just go and watch the film, nothing more..", "a perfect example of a stress buster movie which might be far from reality but did not fail to speak about societal evils in a simplistic way that can reach the mass and not just a niche of society.it was a culmination and product of star studded cast, fast paced plot, amazing action sequences, peak cinematography and editing; along with out of the world background score and dance numbers. although i would say the age rating should be changed and there should be warning sign as a lot of scenes are very graphically depicted in the movie which i felt is not suitable for certain age group that i found in theatre.there are references from popular movie culture to hit the right spots of nostalgia and laughter.overall it's a go to one time watch with friends to feel the rush and enjoy the craftmanship of the movie.", "just as pathetic as it could be. these people take indian audience for granted and then wonder why people go gaga over hollywood movies.don't waste your money, time and peace of mind over this piece of garbage.i jist fail to understand why do people keep manipulating the reviews to force others to watch these crap movies. watch it if you like, please don't post fake appreciation and influence others to waste their time. same thing as happened with pathaan. pathetic movie with unnecessary and unsolicited hype.and dear srk - please die a hero. you are lately just undoing all the good work you had done with swades ans chak de.", "do not go gentle into that good night, old age should burn and rave at close of the day ; rage, rage against the dying of the light. \" the term \"mass film\" is often looked down upon by \"cinephiles\" as a brand of cinema which only caters to the lower strata of our society .jawan, which acts as the second comeback vehicle of arguably the biggest superstar of indian cinema , is a roaring , unabashed celebration of cinema which touches the heartlands of each and every corner of this country.jawan is not just any social drama. it's a drama based in a country so embattled, that the only mantra left is : when in doubt , there is a shah rukh khan .the leaders have failed, the system is corrupt, and a superstar has taken matters into his own hands .jawan is not a film anymore , it's a revolution.it's hard to write a single line of plot without spoiling the experience. let's just say this is now the new definition of \"mass cinema \" .as someone who does not watch too much south cinema , i was absolutely blown away .the presentation, the conflicts , the emotional beats, the large scale action set pieces , every damn thing works and then some .shah rukh khan who has been the posterboy of romantic films for more than three decades has been transformed into a savior , a cult and dare i say , a god in flesh and blood .right from the moment he enters the screen , he commands each and every frame like we could have never imagined. it's a performance so stark from anything that he has done in his career .the likes of nayanthara, deepika is also a winning presence . vijay sethupathi , a brilliant actor also does well however his hindi accent seemed a bit off to me . the backstory of the six girls touches the deepest points of our heart and the characters have been fleshed out so well.but when it is all set and done this is a shah rukh khan's film . there is a scene in the second half where a battered and bruised 'azad' almost breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience . that entire sequence shows the courage of the man and director atlee kumar . to pull off that entire sequence in a film like this , in the times we live in , it takes guts . the theatre where i watched the film resonated with every damn word and was clapping their heart out .jawan , celebrates the identity of a stranger. he is an overflowing vessel, but he is also the dish of the year. when he asks ' main kaun hu? \", it's a question in the shape of a reminder. the reminder is not just trapped by the big screen . it's everywhere - it's in his name, his narrative, his fatherhood, the interviews he's stopped doing, the loyalty of his fans, the cheekiness of 'ask srk' twitter sessions, the venom of his trolls , the boycott hashtags, the stoic nationalism that every often he has to prove, and a decade-long comeback in the making.if pathaan was the first line of that reminder, jawan is the whole punchline. and what a punchline it is.and yes , \" bete ko hath lagane se pehle, baap se baat kar \" #jawan.", "\"jawan\" is a heartfelt patriotic thriller that offers a mix of action, emotions, and family drama. srk and sai dharam tej's performance is a standout, and the film successfully conveys the sacrifices and challenges faced by soldiers. it's a watchable movie for those who appreciate stories of dedication and love for the country. while the film successfully engages the audience with its storytelling, it does have some predictable elements in the plot. however, this doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience. the music and background score, composed by thaman s, enhances the overall viewing experience, especially during the intense moments.i would rate it 7 out of 10.", "jawan is an exemplary homage to both indian and western action flicks that inundated the industries in the early nineties. the movie could well be on its way to replicate what top gun maverick did to an ailing hollywood, in bollywood. slick action sequences, paired with romance, filial affections and some amazing music makes jawan a perfect watch. that, paired with a double dose of shah rukh khan is well worth the money. all said and done, jawan will always be remembered for atlee's extraordinary way of giving shah rukh khan a befitting tribute, proving why he's, for all reasons, 'the last of the stars'. jawan is a big screen spectacle. ready or not, this is a ride that's definitely worth taking.", "film started really well but as the film progresses you are reminded of a lot of films and one particular tv show. pretty much everything is predictable but it is not boring .by the end of the movie i was getting a headache from all the action which was happening. i enjoyed major part of the movie but if you try to find any logic it will be very difficult to enjoy it.some parts of the movie were pointless. but there was so much going on that you can still watch it and won't feel that 3 hrs of your life were horribly wasted.srk looks handsome and in form, nayantara is lovely. vijay sethupathi should have had a much powerful character to make the clash between him and srk epic.", "why i wrote that caption is because after watching this film, i feel all of us the citizen of india must watch this film. this is a mass masala movie with a very important message that makes it class movie. so people who are planning to watch this must take everyone to cinema if you care for your people. this is the real desh bhakti. srk naam to suna hi hoga and atlee ab naam suite hi rahoge delivered a masterpiece. yes for sure jawan has some negative but the positives of this film takes over its negatives so well that u will take the negatives positively. fans will surely go and watch it but this movie is for all. do people who don't like srk watch this and you will love him. final word masterpiece meant for cinema experience only.", "year of srk.a perfect massy movie by atlee. followed the classical trademark of director and excelled in it. every entry of srk was fabulous and the whole bunch of crowd were shouting their lungs out. (although i was slightly disappointed with the south delhi crowd....mehh; these guys can't enjoy i think).coming to the positive aspects of the movie: ohhh srk, every shot of him was fabulous, be it the entry scene or the little wittu humour. i will never forget the interval block that i have seen in this movie. oh my god. you can't miss that. srk excelled in all the roles that he played ( i will not reveal the number of roles as it can be a spoiler for some).nayanthara as the other lead portrayed a strong female lead that is rare to see in today's massy movies. she has a good screen presence especially in the first half.deepika though have limited role but her expressions and acting deserve special praise.the supporting female caste is fabulous. their back stories really made me emotional for moments. i only know the name of sanya malhotra among them so will not try to cool to mention them all. but i would say they are the main characters of the movie after srk.red chilies nailed once again. the vfx work was fabulous. the starting scene looked very eye soothing.camerwork deserves extra praise especially for its movements along with the actor.social issues that were pointed out were dealt in a very sophisticated and a excellent way. this deserves another applause.if i point out the negatives, there a quite a few; but it is important to point them: vijay sethupathi; in my opinion he was highly underutilised. he deserved a greater screentime with a better writing. his motives though were made clear, his backstory was not shown properly according to me. the russian guy angle was wasted. he is such a kind of actor who deserved better writing than this.underutilised anirudh; the bgm was very much but is not at par with anirudh's potential. jailer's bgm was much better than this and lifter the movie very well.open endings; there were many sub plots that weren't dealt properly. the starting north east one was of great potential if shown. the backstories should be incorporated in a better way to emotionally engage the public in the second half. although i know movie can't be more long than this, but this is what i feel.third act; compared to interval block, third act kind of disappoints the viewer. it was good but it can be made to a different level.in the end, director atlee made a wholesome package for everyone. just enjoy the movie and hoot as much as you can.celebrate it.", "jawan mega blockbuster \"jawan\" is an electrifying rollercoaster of action and emotion that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. shah rukh khan's performance is nothing short of phenomenal as he portrays a man determined to make a difference in society. the film's gripping storyline, combined with heart-pounding action sequences, makes it a must-watch for any action-thriller enthusiast. directorial brilliance and a powerful message about rectifying societal wrongs elevate this film to a whole new level. \"jawan\" is a thrilling ride that will leave you inspired and thoroughly entertained. don't miss it!", "one time watchable movie. every actor's acting was good in movie.the most weird thing about this movie was i felt first half of the movie was better than the second half which is not usually how movies work..secondly if the makers of the movie had concentrated more on the story of the movie than the unnecessary action sequences it could have been much better movie than this.there was some scenes which didn't make sense and unnecessary.like sanjay dutt entire scene was unnecessary and vijay settupatti's man just standing and watching him getting beaten and don't want to give more spoilers you watch it and you will get it.", "bollywood never fails to dissapoint, i don't know why there is a fuss about it. it's just like any other uninspiring hindi movie that's been coming out from the past couple of years.it fell short of what i was expecting seeing the uproar and excitement generated around it, but only to witness that it was nothing but paid media.lacklustre script along with faltering direction was a testament to its mediocrity like any other bolly movies coming nowadays. i hadn't seen any bolly movie since long and had huge expectations but it failed to resonate. hope bollywood can come up with better content, till the i would stick to on demand streaming service.", "*jawan (2023) -*i am sure you might have already watched it.. but if haven't yet then believe me; it's not a film, but a festival so celebrate it with yours. it's a must watch. a towering starcast, never seen before actions, power packed storyline, emphatic thrills and exceptionally well performances make sure you get the worth double of your spent money. it's a massively massy film and paisa wasool by all means.who am i to make comments for over 1000cr persona, the *king of bollywood*, the srk and his magnum opus performance! i am out of words for him here. nayanthara is magnificent and stylish, vijay sethupathi is brilliant and dangerous in his villainous character, deepika padukone is beautiful and elegant, sunil grover is fair in his small role, there's a team of 6 ladies is strong and impressive and film has an interesting cameo too.i am not going to reveal the storyline because it is such a crucial to be felt inside the theatre only! it has many layers and one after another unfolds in captivating ways which keeps you mesmerized till the end. also without mentioning any spoilers and keeping it short i would say; it's an out and out srk's show! it's a pure masala film with all required spices like huge production values, outstanding actions, sensible emotions, excellent music, multi layered storyline, spendid vfx, enthralling bgm, some exceptional acting, stylish and slick, little comedy and a dash of patriotism.film is very entertaining and has everything you are expecting; and that too in south style. yes! atlee's direction has given the film a southern edge. it's a complete family package and can be enjoyed with kids and elders too. there's hardly anything i observed otherwise and i would like to rate jawan 4 / 5 (). first half of the film is better than what comes after interval, plus climax contains less thrills and magnitude as compared to what has shown till then in the film (hence i've deducted one star too for the same). as said it's a compulsory watch and would offer much more than your anticipation.*what i liked most? -* shahrukh khan in different avatars.*p. s. -* good to go girls? ready chief!*by - niraj solanki..!*", "so here cometh the king to take on the system,the corrupt,the shackles of law in a larger than life massive scale vigilante. it's a shah rukh khan show all in all, he's the oppenheimer in a land of barbie, he's the joker , he's the batman , he's the massiah of the mass. atlee gave him a massive ground to play and he ruled like a king of the jungle, at one point even subtly breaking the fourth wall.plot of the movie is simple, it's one man's (vikram rathore) extravagant larger than life journey to prove his innocence,his love and dedication for his country and his incomplete character arc completed by his son (azad) ,raised in a female correctional home by his mother and lots of other innocent mothers. he tries to prove his father's innocence by pointing at the system with his finger by reverting the wrongs being done. he starts by avenging his 'girls' and ends the emotional journey with reunion with his father and his squad of jawans.atlee has done a superb job by maintaining the tempo of film throughout,it never feels too much ,the screenplay is tight with rapid transitional scenes. occasionally the scenes are so fast that it doesn't give you time to deeply connect emotionally with the character (or to catch a breath after hooting and shouting vis a vis). he creates an edge of the seat thriller mixing the sambar with the bhature. cherry on top is anirudhs background score which is at par with any international and cinematography by g. k vishnu. vfx department has done incredible job throughout the film specially with the mid action slow mos.it's a srkcentric film and he does most of the heavy lifting with all his wit ,his finesse and energetic action sequences. he takes on the government,system subtly in his own way and reaches the mass with a new avatar everytime. nayanthara is mature ,bold ,fit ,sweet and the mole in her philtrum exponentially beautified her personality,not just a side kick but she's there is kick some asses. however in the second half i feel she got sidelined a bit. sanya malhotra does justice to her character,all the other girls and boys did their part well. vijay setupathi is the joker with an accent,he has done his part brilliantly. he is the direct antagonist to jawan and he stands on top of his game in every scene he comes in. however i feel his character was little subdued to showcase the hero.overall the film comes with lots of social messages packed in high octane action sequences with a pinch of romance, patriotism,swag entrys,larger than life characters doing physics defying stunts and a hyperhooting interval drop scene. it entertains and teaches the audience and after you get out of the theater it makes you feel like not a single rupee is wasted. good to go,king.", "jawan, a film that initially showed promise, unfortunately, crumbled under its own weight. it is disheartening to witness a talented actor like shahrukh khan involve himself in such a disappointing project. the audience today seeks realistic movies with believable stories, and jawan failed to deliver on that front. it can be categorized as nothing more than utter bollywood rubbish.my recommendation would be to save your valuable time and skip this film entirely. perhaps, when it eventually releases on netflix, you can give it a chance if you're curious. however, i must warn you that the overall rating for jawan stands at a mere 1 out of 10.", "a pure entertainment masala action thrill ride with amazing over the top action set-pieces that also tries to delve into some serious issues of the country ranging from farmer suicides to corrupt political system run by crony capitalists. it is also a call for the power of the ballot and the public's right and duty to question each and everyone.jawan has the soul of rang de basanti and a wednesday that has been infused with cocaine and action cranked to the maximum.the side characters could have been more fleshed out and the momentum does drop a little at the start of the second half but it picks up towards the end. enjoyed it more than pathaan.", "the hype was unreal and i entirely bought into it, and i was not disappointed either. jawan was a great theatre experience but what surprised me most was how politically charged it was. just like the tradition of tamil cinema(it's written and directed by a tamil filmmaker named atlee), it focuses on a lot of social issues that range from well-intentioned to horribly misguided. but then again it is to be expected because you can't possibly cram all that much into a 165-minute film without losing nuances.the film is a celebration of srk and his undeniable charisma, and he fully got the assignment and the pitch at which he needs to perform. the nonchalant swagger he possesses, especially in the role of vikram rathod is awesome. the production design is incredible and the film is breathtakingly shot, inventively edited, well-choreographed, and excellently acted. action choreography is great and action setpieces are really good. the film also doesn't skimp on hand-to-hand combat sequences as those are also filmed with finesse, although it could have used fewer slo-mo shots.the musical score by anirudh is amazing although the songs range from meh to terrible. the film also suffers from an overabundance of forced emotions and many times, it feels manipulated too. the runtime could have been shortened since by the time the film comes to a close and two shahrukhs are burning the dance floor on 'not ramaiya vastavaiya', you feel a bit exhausted, not because it's boring but due to its sheer length. but these few problems aside, the film was a terrifically engaging affair that fulfils its promise of bringing a full-on entertainer with srk in a never-before-seen avatar.overall, jawan was a fantastic cinema experience for me and leaves me hopeful for more such films where two or more industries collaborate to bring out their best respective versions.love you king khan!"]}

["a great documentary that premiered a few months after hr giger died. unfortunately, it started shooting when hr giger's health was already clearly deteriorating. the personal one on one interviews with him are quite short, many interviews in the documentary are with his personal and professional entourage.the storytelling is not very linear, some old footage from giger's youth and from his various movie/hollywood assignments are mixed in. you will see more interview clips with giger himself in these segments.as an introduction and indicator if this movie is interesting to you, watch the short movie 'hr giger home made' (available for free on youtube), which uses the same setting in giger's house and garden in zurich, switzerland.i would recommend this movie to all (surreal) art lovers, especially those who might have prejudices and only know his body of work (giger also was quite often reduced to his work on the alien creature, which doesn't do him justice at all) but not the real and unique person/artist behind it.ps: in case of further interest in the artist and his body of work. the official hr giger museum (in the picturesque gruyeres region in switzerland, giger's home country) showcases the largest collection of the artist's work from the 1960s until the present day. the top floor of the museum houses giger's own art collection.", "he feels at home in places we would flee from and lives his life among the very things we fear. throughout his life, h. r. giger had inhabited the world of the uncanny, a dark universe on the brink of many an abyss.most of us know giger from \"alien\" if we know him at all. his work is very recognizable and has been emulated by many artists over the last thirty years or so. but we may not know much about him beyond his aliens. what of his personal life or other work? this film digs into that and we see just what sort of person he is (or was). people may even be surprised to find that giger was european. this was no secret, but perhaps not common knowledge. we also learn how he got his start, really relying on posters to get his work in font of audiences. not your typical method.", "just what you might have expected: hr giger's home is a museum of the macabre. the celebrated creator of the alien monster and a painter, sculptor, and architect as well, giger inhabits a world of gargoyles and monsters, straight from his imagination to us. dark star: h r giger's world is an intriguing documentary sometimes as weird and inscrutable as his mind. it certainly doesn't burden the audience with analysis.as director belinda sallin tracks us through the baroque museum that is his zurich house, we see a phantasmagoria of monsters from egyptian-monarch-looking portraits to old skulls, one of which he dragged around by string when a young boy. while the camera passes his oscar on a shelf, the spare narration overall gives no nod to this achievement (oscar for best visual effects for ridley scott's alien), typical of the documentary's minimalist approach.appearances by his collaborators like gabriel fischer, a metal musician, sometimes refer to the artist's kindness, and they occasionally give insight into the psycho-sexual, violent undertow of his startling images. the now humble man appears as if in the aftermath of a stroke, moving and speaking slowly and deliberately, but always kindly as he autographs body parts and throws off a sly smile or two.perhaps the purpose of limiting explanation about his work is to let the array of deeply symbolic creations out of his subconscious speak for themselves, almost defying analysis. although freud would have a holiday assessing giger's innermost demons, giger's expressionism remains delightful impressionism for viewers.", "i wouldn't consider myself a rabid fan of gigers work, i don't have anything besides the alien movies and a poster packed away somewhere to show my love of giger. that being said you can't deny the genius that is giger and this documentary had everything i could hope to see from the man and his small crew of loyal followers. in dark star the filmmakers give us more than just a peek at gigers expansive often discussed home. giger is a gentle man, a quiet and humble eccentric who puts you through a range of emotions in his amazing yet sometimes tragic life. everything giger owns and has surrounded himself with has his biomechanical signature on it. i'm very happy dark star was completed while giger was still alive i don't think anything can beat seeing his life through his eyes. absolutely fascinating

talent- and in what turned out to be his \"final days,\" as it were. i've always wondered why filmmakers didn't make greater use of giger. imagine a train, designed by giger, entering a tunnel also designed by him. or cave sets connected by tunnels on an alien world that lead to... gigerland underground- the bowels of the planet itself. of all the possibilities, the most intriguing to me would have been to see room 101 from george orwell's nineteen eighty-four designed by giger: imagine the long walk down the corridor to that room, every step of the way looking like a hallway in his home. brrr...", "well, as i sat down in 2021 to watch the 2014 documentary / biography about hr giger for the first time, i must admit that i was expecting a bit more than what this documentary actually managed to deliver.now, it should be said that the words documentary and biography should be taken very lightly when you sit down to watch the 2014 \"dark star: hr gigers welt\".it felt more of a reality tv episode of some kind where you follow a famous person around for a day, than it did as an enlightening and informational documentary.this 2014 documentary offers some insight into the early life of the artist and a bit into whom he was, but it was hardly a fulfilling documentary for me, and i must admit that i was not particularly thrilled or entertained by what was being shown and told.while i definitely enjoyed the artwork of hr giger, then this documentary hardly does the man much of any justice. especially not if you are interested in knowing more about his work, the man himself, and such. but hey, if you want to follow a former artist around for a day or two, then this is the stuff for you.i am rating \"dark star: hr gigers welt\" a three out of ten stars, as the documentary failed to deliver something wholesome for me.", "'dark star: h.r. giger's world': two and a half stars (out of five)a documentary film exploring the life, and work, of the popular swiss painter, sculptor and set designer (known as) h.r. giger. the film focuses on giger, at the age of 74, when his health was severely deteriorating. it was written and directed by belinda sallin, in her feature film debut, and it contains multiple interviews with giger, as well as his friends and work associates. i found the movie to be extremely slow-paced, even boring (at times), but still, definitely, visually pleasing (like the majority of giger's work). the movie takes place in the last days of giger's life, shortly before he died (on may 12, 2014). the filmmaker interviews giger, and follows him around, watching him slowly do day-to-day things. sallin also interviews giger's wife, and multiple co-workers, and friends of his, as well. a lot of the visuals are filled with giger's beautiful art.the film, like i said, is really slow paced, to a somewhat painful extent; i found my thoughts drifting (a lot)! it is interesting, getting to know giger, if only just a little, in his final days of life. it's also cool to see that he was a 'cat person', like me! i can never really get tired of looking at his fascinating art, too; but i wish there would have been more time spent on 'alien', or 'species'. although i was bored, i'm sure obsessive fans of his will be more than pleased.watch our movie review show 'movie talk' at:", "imo - \"dark star\" was a pretty bleak and grim look at artist, h.r. giger's life who (at the time of this production) was clearly approaching his death with both his physical and mental health deteriorating at a rapid pace.when \"dark star\" wasn't focusing in on giger's overall declining state of health, it, at least, did invite the viewer to take a brief glimpse at some examples of his more notable artistic accomplishments.", "instead of being a joyous celebration of the life and artwork of h.r. giger, the man who (in 1979) had created \"alien\" (syfy's most hideously awesome monster of all)..... \"dark star\" was truly a sad, pathetic, and oppressively suffocating film documenting the final year of giger's life as he was obviously deteriorating both physically and, especially, mentally.it was almost horrifying to see that giger had become so utterly consumed (in an unbalanced way) by his own artwork and that the stifling interior of his home in switzerland represented that of the inside of a decrepit crypt of a hording pack-rat.yes. i do fully respect giger as being the gifted illustrator who created \"alien\" - but this documentary's uncomfortable ambiance gave me the creeps. from start to finish - it had squalor, oppressiveness, and death clearly written all over it.and, with that - i totally resent director, belinda sallin for presenting giger in the disrespectful way that she did (as a doddering, old kook) in this truly repulsive presentation.*note* - in 2014 - hans rudolf giger (70 at the time) died from a fall sustained in the hospital.", "don't bother watching this crap, there's no subs for the people speaking in english, when others who spoke different languages got english subs, totally unfair for us deafs who wants to understand this fricking documentary, thanks a lot for wasting our

critics don't see what is in front of them. the pacing only seems slow if you're spending your other reviews telling people how wonderful super hero and \"fast and furious\" movies are. how can it be slow if the whole thing takes place over a period of about three weeks? it's paced the way it should be to allow a good look at bernadette, who she is, how she got there and the demons she deals with. it's a wonderful look at the closeness between a daughter and her mother, when the daughter often finds herself being the more mature of the two. the best part of the movie, as it should be, is bernadette, played to mercurial perfection by cate blanchett. under the obvious disruption of a manic personality, blanchett also allows the intelligence, humor and pain of the character to show through. it's a tremendous performance and, fortunately, some of the awards are paying attention to it despite the critics. it's a thoughtful, but also very funny movie. people should give it a chance.", "some reviewers criticized the film's pacing, i was fine with it. it's clear from the beginning the family is non-tradiotional, living in partially renovated, unkempt colossal house in a high end seattle among well kept homes. snobbery abounds. the viewer wonders about the past and it is revealed little by little in various ways. bernadette & her daughter are unusually close, the parents less so. the ultimate strength of their bonds is what drives the last 1/3. i did snort-laugh a few times, for the record. a good film for families ( kids over 12 or so) to watch which may lead to discussions. cate b's performance is excellent!", "started out at little slow and ended strong. the director took to long to help us understand the complexity of bernadette and her real struggles -which we can all identify with, so that we really liked and rooted for her. once the movie got there it took off and ended strong. one criticism overall and not so much about this movie but an overall statement. if a movie is set in a specific city - film it in that city. there were obvious obligatory scenes of seattle but it was clearly filmed mostly elsewhere.", "just i love it. not only for the basic motif than cate blanchett is one of my favorit actress , for the art of billy crudup or because the young emma nelson reminds me one of my students, but because all is...just lovely. amix of depression, family, life , passion, loneliness and the result of vocation. an adorable film. just an adorable one. for storytelling, acting, humor , extravagance and tension. and in few scenes, for the status of mirror.", "director richard linklater is one that does movies in an in depth manner as they are long drawn out and almost always deal with life and personal matters. and most viewers as they watch can relate to them and most face some in real life. this latest \"where'd you go, bernadette\" is one that deals with somewhat of a midlife drama as the head character wants a change and escape to a new scene all while wanting to live past glory again.bernadette fox(cate blanchett) is a professional woman an inventor, teacher, wife, and mom who had a very creative past only now her life is stuck in neutral. it's like she can't get no satisfaction! so she needs a new journey a new adventure and discovery. so upon taking a getaway in somewhat of a secretive manner the world opens back up and a new light shines for her! overall really a picture of once again finding self discovery and old glory thru escape, not one of richard's best works and the performance from cate is only okay, still it's a watch for some drama and inspiration.", "richard linklater, for me is a solid filmmaker. i think the before trilogy is masterful and damn near perfect and while his other work doesn't resonate as well for me he's had some great films. i didn't know a whole lot about this film, other than it being based on a book i've never read and it looking like quite a stylish film though a very curious one. after watching, i'm sort of on the fence of whether i liked it or not. the needle is right in the center.the film is about a former architect named bernadette fox and her life. she hates people, has rows with her neighbor, and is having issues with her husband and her own mental health. things come to a head where her life becomes so disorganized that an intervention is called to help her get better. before you know it bernadette disappears and her family must track her and get her back. its hard to summarize the plot of this film because this isn't really an event that takes center stage in this film.i feel like this film was just so uneven. on one hand you have a very good performance by the always amazing, cate blanchett. i love the interactions with her and kristen wig's character. the writing and humor is sharp and witty at times but like bernadette, it disappears as the film trails along. i can't really put a finger on what makes this book special because the film makes me wonder why we really have to care for it.i feel like a lot of this was a swing and a miss for linklater who is always trying to challenge himself. there are things to appreciate, like the musical score and performances but not a whole lot else in this rather uneventful and non memorable film. luckily for me this was a first film in a double feature, with the latter feature really making up for my time at the cinema.5.5/10", "my wife and i went to see this movie because kristen wiig is in it and it looked like it would be funny. it is funny - but it is a lot more. it is quirky (we love quirky movies!), edgy, sometimes uncomfortable, but mostly enlightening (as in bringing light in). it could have been titled \"where'd you go human spirit?\", or \"where'd you go imagination?, or \"this is what happens to society when fear drives honest, loving, intelligent people to start acting weird and give up on each other\". and it shows us the answer in a very positive way. so, it was not bridesmaids. closer to \"welcome to me\" or \"skeleton twins\" maybe (i loved both), but not really like any other movie i can think of. note: the critics seemed to not like it. that is almost a sure sign of a good movie to me. bless their pointy little heads.", "yes, it's a hollywood film with all the clever coincidences and neat n' tidy endings, but it is also very clever, well acted, and even poetic. go see a film that doesn't involve flying superheroes, gun fights, or animated toys...you'll be glad you did.", "where'd you go, bernadette is based off of the novel of the same name and tells the story of bernadette fox who is going through a bit of a midlife crisis as it begins to effect the people around her. i've been really interested in this film ever since richard linklater's name was a attached. he is a director i admire and couldn't wait, however reviews for this film have not been kind and i really don't understand why.this film manages to balance drama and comedy in a very clever and consistent way that really works in my opinion. the acting all around is very good, especially from cate blanchett who wonderfully portrays this character in a quirky and self destructive way that still makes you feel sorry and care for her. billy crudup, a very underrated actor also does a great job as he is trying to keep his family from fallon apart.the story is very quirky, but as i said balances with drama as well making it feel well rounded and never feels too whimsical. it's just right and is very heartfelt and relatable. it can be sappy at times, but i didn't mind it at all.perhaps the acting from the daughter could have been better and the trailers pitched a very different film, but i think what we got is funny, heartfelt and very well acted. it's not up there with linklater's best, but it is a win for me.", "blanchett, crudup, wiig, fishburne, linklater. you'd really think would have come out better. certainly watchable but whatever was in the source material was not brought out to make this really move. the ending was rather predictable and cheesy and god know what that final prop was", "my wife and i watched this movie at home on dvd from our public library. we enjoyed it, all actors are good in the roles and to me blanchett turns in one of her better performances as the genius architect that ceased to create after her difficulties with pregnancy and motherhood.cate blanchett is bernadette, living in seattle with her microsoft executive husband and teen daughter. she doesn't do much anymore, they bought an old large fixer upper but are not fixing it up. she doesn't seem to have any friends. at one point her family arranges an intervention, they think bernadette needs to be hospitalized but she escapes.having planned a trip at their daughter's request, to antarctica, and seemingly being aborted, through a series of quirky events all three of them end up there and bernadette finds the inspiration to reignite her passion for architecture.good movie. filmed partly in greenland standing in for antarctica,", "the first two thirds of the movie were quirky and at times funny and at other times mildly disturbing. cate blanchett played the slight nutty has-been genius architect to a t. her nuttiness drove the movie forward as the other characters were somewhat banal.the final third was a (and i have stolen this from another review here) \"cooky cutter sitcom ending\". all of a sudden blanchett's character was back to boring and banal with the rest of them.what started out as promising, ended with a fizzle.", "i love all of linklater's work, because it is so humble, down-to-earth and basic. this is no exception. i have not read the novel, so cannot comment on if the adaptation is true to the novel. however, i loved all the antarctica scenes, the opening and the ending in particular. it is spot on about human nature, and how we overlook our basic needs and desires most of the times to just get on with our life. it is also about how most of the time people dont spare any time to understand and analyze each other. judging one another is much more easier. that is because people are getting lazier to work on one another in our age. blanchett as always is great in this role. curdrup is miscast, his acting is pretty flat and boring. could be better , that is why a 7. this movie and its likes are under- appreciated for the same reason that we have / will continue to have zillions of superhero movies/ series.", "i usually never write reviews, but i felt i had to after watching this. although \"where'd you go, bernadette\" was filled with a star-studded cast, and great acting, it left out many of the pieces that made the book so wonderful. so much of the plot changed, and i'm sure that was to make it more relatable to viewers, but it really misses the mystery and magic this story holds. it's a story completely out of the box for hollywood, and i wish it could have been told that same way. this is one of my favorite books and it truly is a wonderful, hilarious, slightly dark, and mysterious read. the story deserves so much more than what it was given with this screenplay. so, with that, i highly recommend reading \"where'd you go, bernadette,\" you won't be disappointed.", "i ended up seeing this movie to kill some time and i am so glad i did. as someone with anxiety, depression, and past trauma, this movie moved me. the way people can judge others with mental health issues when they have no idea what it's like, is appalling. cate blanchet's portrayal of someone fighting inner demons while fighting people who completely misunderstand her is awe-inspiring. i highly recommend this movie for anyone- especially anyone who has or knows someone with mental health issues. i will be taking everyone i know to see this movie.", "director linklater did a great job of using a faux youtube documentary to flesh out cate blanchett's bernadette character. it's not obtrusive or distracting, and it meshed well with the actual story. unfortunately, it rendered emma nelson's voiceover narration-- which i usually hate anyway-- even more pointless.although the scenes with emma nelson's bee and bernadette are the most heartfelt and poignant in the movie, nelson had quite a few cringe-worthy lines throughout it. one of the most hideous lines was delivered when she is damning her father (billy crudup) for working while she and her unemployed mother were forced to live together in a loving relationship on a massive estate in a well-to-do seattle neighborhood. to quote colonel kurtz (who is also mentioned in this film), \"the horror.... the horror.\" nelson also dives into such lines with all of the overzealousness of a young actor who is unaware that they're garbage. a more seasoned actor would have half-mumbled them.fortunately for linklater, cate blanchett is in his film. she demonstrated why people believe that she is one of the greatest actors of this century by reeling in the supporting cast's slack and causing us to forget some of the story's shortcomings.i'm usually unamused by linklater's obsession with the mundane, but in this film there was something adorable about seeing bernadette's daughter perform at an elementary school function and watching kristen wiig's character host a kids' party in her house. the quirkiness served it well. overall, i'm glad that i watched this film-- it was a welcome relief from the disney monopoly. get out there and enjoy non-disneyized cinema while you still can, folks.", "i have seen many linklater films and they are seldom disappointing. but this one is a real stinker. bernadette comes across more as myopic and antagonizing than a woman who has stalled in her career as an architect.cate blanchette does not make her character believable as a person suffering and feeling like a failure in her career, marriage, and motherhood. i must admit the first half of the movie is interesting but then the story becomes a hallmark mystery as her husband and daughter go on the hunt to find bernadette. the plot becomes so saccharine and sentimental i was wondering if linklater had lost interest in the film and decided to just bring it to an end.", "bernadette is the kind of woman you would cross the road to avoid and who would also cross the road to avoid meeting you and she's just the perfect character for cate blanchett to add to her portfolio of oddballs. she's also married to something of an oddball, (billy crudup), who's some kind of computer genius and between them they have managed to create a nice, normal teenage daughter, (newcomer emma nelson, superb), and they all live in a seattle mansion that is literally falling apart. but bernadette isn't just a sociopathic oddball; she is, or was, a great architect who dropped out and whose midlife crisis has lasted a couple of decades.\"where'd you go, bernadette\" is a richard linklater comedy so you know we are in odddball territory to begin with. what you might not realise is that it's also very funny and naturally more than a little sad. it's like a walking, talking new yorker cartoon brought to glorious life and not just by blanchett, (no-one does crazy quite like her), crudup and nelson but by a terrific supporting cast headed by kristen wiig and with pitch-perfect turns from judy greer, zoe chao, laurence fishburne, david paymer and steve zahn. i loved every crazy, off-the-wall and marvellously moving moment.", "my rating is not quite as high, because i compare it to the book. the book storyline is non-linear, and starts off with bernadette having disappeared. finding her seems to be less straight forward than in the movie and make the story more intriguing. but having said that i thought the movie portrayed the characters and relationships well. definitely worth seeing", "in an age when more working people than ever can't afford to feed their families, housing is a luxury and work is more like slavery it's heartening to see a film take on these difficult topics..oh, wait. it didn't. at all. it focused on a privileged white woman, in a privileged white upper class neighbourhood with a privileged white upper class family who experiences social anxiety and some depression. it's difficult to relate to her, given that she's a celebrated architect that can afford a last minute trip to antarctica, and i kept waiting for this film to make sense to me, but it just made me cringe the longer it went on to the point that i had to mute the last ten minutes. i get that mental health can effect anyone irrespective of material wealth, but i didn't feel that this was fully explored, just glossed over and resolved in a bland and unsatisfying and unlikely way. but god love her, cate tries hard and i liked her character way more when she was slightly bad and i didn't feel like that aspect of her needed to change. just a weird hallmark film with a weird hallmark ending.", "after all these fairly reactions the film got, i still expected to like it because i love richard linklater, but sure didn't expect to love it like i do. to me this simply is a beautiful movie with a lot of heart and endless little details that make it yet another fantastic, completely lovely linklater film. the only real problem i had was the score because it felt a bit basic and often times unnecessary. that's really it. every performance in here is great, and cate blanchett definitely gives one of the best in recent memory. i was fully engaged and just wished the best for her. how blanchett went from one emotion to the next in a millisecond was extremely impressive and felt absolutely true to life. i went to see where'd you go, bernadette with my mum, who loved it as well and who was surprised by that since she thought it had a slow beginning. i, as a linklater fan of course liked the slow setup a bunch. anyway, the story of the film spoke to me a lot and i saw something of my mother in bernadette a few times, so some moments and the dialogue broke my heart, and not necessarily in a bad way, but it sure was kind of though at times. she was bawling at the end, and felt very good afterwards. that's exactly what cinema should be able to archive, i think. i'm honestly getting emotional just thinking about the movie right now, a few hours after having seen it, and that's a very positive sign, isn't it? i'm so happy it touched me the way it did. it's one of my favourite films of the year so far and i'll gladly watch it again. it really is a beautiful thing that richard linklater keeps getting films made all the time in the current state of filmmaking. it must be because he has earned so much respect over all these years. i sure have still got to see a movie of his i didn't at the very least like, and i'm looking forward to watching a lot of his projects i haven't seen yet over the next months. i am deeply uplifted by where'd you go, bernadette and was always very much into it. characters are where it's at for me anyway. believable people you kinda know, or feel like you do, brought to screen with a lot of care. when most things in life feel sort of hopeless, i think this is what you need to see.", "where she began was slightly sketchy for me. the movie starts off too slow for lack of a better term. i like cate blanchette and her chemistry with billy cludrup and lawrence fishburne, which was able to keep me focus, but i have to admit bernadette's problems...to put it nicely, me and bernadette are from two different worlds and the movie itself seem to make us drift apart more. all that did change once they began trying to find a solution to bernadette's problems i really like that part. so overall the film felt heartwarming and inspiring. overall i enjoyed it.", "at first i only put it on because kristin wig. it starts off pretty slow but it is soooo worth the watch. get the kleenex's ready!", "i enjoyed the storyline and the architecture. i recommend watching the movie", "she must create so she doesn't become a menace to society. a beautiful insight into the mind of an artist who bottled up her creative drive, and became dysfunctional.", "the story is very thin and they barely tackle the issues it raises. so why worth the watch you ask?cate blanchet is just amazing. if you had anxiety and are an introvert she will touch your heart.the ability to completely immerse in a character and take you on a journey is a rare gift. she is one the best actresses of our time. just watch to marvel at her gift.", "richard linklater has made several movies notable for their originality and excellence - with 'dazed and confused', 'tape', 'boyhood' and the 'before sunrise/sunset/midnight' trilogy being the cream of the crop. he has also made a couple of clunkers, but bernadette is almost certainly his career low. the acting, script and direction are so abysmal, it's hard to know whether the film was intended to be a drama, comedy or farce.the plot tells how a housewife, married to a successful software geek, is having a mid-life crisis over abandoning her brilliant early career as an architect and designer. after estranging herself from family and neighbors with chronic grouchiness and bizarre behavior, she absconds. the mystery of her disappearance lasts approximately three minutes before bernadette's husband and daughter figure out her destination and set off in pursuit. already dire, from that point onward the film descends to the level of ineptitude and sentimentality usually found in provincial amateur dramatics. overall, it would be gross deception to describe it as anything better than an embarrassing mess.", "ok, i am in love with cate blanchett, but who isn't?with that in mind, this movie may not be citizen kane, but it is heartfelt, well acted and shows the reality of being a creative genius in today's society and how hard it is to keep the faith in humanity and life in general. whatever that means, i have no idea. but, this film made me feel good, and that is important to me. i'm giving it a 10 because i can.", "she disrupts the lives of her daughter and husband due to her own eccentricities and fickle personality. in the end is vindicated because she finds a project she enjoys. her family adjusts their lives to solely serve and center around her needs. like-minded individuals will enjoy the movie. others will pity a woman who makes her allows her personal issues and lack of self-control to prevent people around her from enjoying their lives.", "let's be honest, the book was almost impossible to turn into a (good) movie, it's witty, funny, sad, and altogether crazy at the same time, plus, there are a lot of e-mails, letters and extra material that makes sense when you are reading them but not so much in a movie. the only way that they could have got them in the film was by adding a narrator, which they didn't, and in the process, lost the best the book has. a good narrator from beginning to end. then... this movie has none of bernadette funny yet crazy moments, it has no tone, or it doesn't decide what is going to be, a comedy or a drama? in the end, it's none. everything feels rushed and, in the book, you got to find the answers in due course. the same does not happen here.one thing that did bother me, they book made a huge emphasis on not using anything from apple since elgin works at microsoft and they are anathema to its workers, of course, then, those products keep appearing all over the movie.what a pity.ps: read the book, it's everything this film is not.", "where'd you go, bernadette? review:from writer/director richard linklater, where'd you go, bernadette? follows a loving mom, cate blanchett, who becomes compelled to reconnect with her creative passions after years of sacrificing herself for her family. her leap of faith takes her on an epic adventure that jump-starts her life and leads to her triumphant rediscovery. i remember seeing this trailer last year and waiting for the release in february. then it got pushed up to august and i somewhat forgot about it but once i saw the trailers again, i still thought it looked like an interesting movie. as the date came closer it seemed to me that the campaign had lost some steam and not many people would come see this. it ended up not even making the top ten for weekend box office results even though it was a new release. when i went to see it opening night there were only two others there. what also made me nervous was on rotten tomatoes it had a score of 46%. after seeing this comedy/mystery, i didn't think it deserved all the hate it was getting. i think this is a good movie, not the best ever but an enjoyable watch. the plot was fine, but i think that's where it struggled the most. it's always so interesting to me when companies market movies and make it seem like it's one thing, but it's something different. in the case of where'd you go, burnadette? we are lead to believe this is a story of a woman disappearing and their family trying to find her in an adventure/comedy movie. i would say that's about the final act of the movie. you could argue to say a little bit of the second act but it was really hard to tell for this movie. if you came to see that you'll get a good 45 minutes out of that. what we really get is a story of a woman struggling with a mental illness that's affected her, her loved ones, and those around her. cate blanchett is an amazing actress and honestly this was one of my favorite performances by her. she had so much fun with the character of bernadette. by far the best aspect of the movie. i really enjoyed exploring her mental problems. she's a very extreme introvert, insomniac, and isn't the most serious person when coming to moments where she should act more professional. i think that's really the title of the movie. they're asking where she went mostly mentally and not as much physically. she used to be this big architect and had a vision but that vision didn't work out. the reason why she is the way she is formed from the one vision she had that didn't work out. that reason felt weak to me and was shown in a very odd way. we get the exposition through a youtube video that appears a few times in the movie. it just seemed like i was watching a totally different movie and didn't really like that. i should add these really aren't spoilers because i could figure most of this out from various trailers and teasers. tonally, it struggled. i felt it was more like two different movies. one being about mental illness and one about finding her. i preferred the mental illness. there were more interesting scenes with some great actors. kristen wiig did fine, not her best performance ever but enjoyable to watch. billy crudup is a great actor and i loved his relationship with cate blanchett. he was the more serious and just trying to help but it never works. the daughter in the movie, played by emma nelson, is a main character but i didn't really like her that much. it was her first time acting so she was trying but she has a ways to go yet. when blanchett wasn't on screen it seemed as if it had to be nelson being the main character and i just didn't like having her taking the rains and trying to see her point of view. some of the stuff she's saying was meant for us to take her side but i didn't really feel that way. one thing that i'd like to add for the plot is there's a side story with a person she's emailing as a personal assistant kind of thing. something happens with that and it's supposed to be a big deal but once it's resolved, which wasn't hard, it's just thrown away. i don't know if it was necessary to the plot but it just felt a little weird. past those few issues it's an enjoyable movie. it's fun to see the craziness that ensues from one person's own problems and how they deal with them. tonally it was messed up. it sometimes worked because bernadette is supposed to be a messed up kind of person. but that's the fun of it. blanchett's performance makes the whole thing. she'll most likely get a globe nomination because everyone loves her and she does a good job. if you want to watch a kind of feel good movie for the day i would recommend this. it's nothing great but it's still enjoyable and interesting.my grade: b", "another day, another time to review movies and weeks two of the 5 movie reviews a week continues. hi robbie k here, and today we will be looking at yet another book turned movie, as pop culture icons and interesting concepts are interpreted for the silver screen. now you know the usual sayings, movie versions are often not as good as the literature counterparts, but that does not mean it's not worth a chance to see the visual interpretation unfold. well, once again yours truly is back in the artificially lit trenches to determine if this is a movie worth your time. let's get started:movie: where'd you go bernadette (2019)director: richard linklater writers: richard linklater (screenplay by), holly gent (screenplay by) stars: cate blanchett, judy greer, kristen wiig likes:good acting nice portrayal of mental illness cute good morals fairly good pace cyndi lauper tributedislikes:a little melodramatic dryer comedy some rather useless characters/plots a little more connecting no mystery whatsoever the abrupt endsummary:the movie in a way feels much like a book performance or big budget play. blanchett in particular does a lot of heavy lifting with the grandiose character of bernadette and is truly the person to captivate you in this story. sure the other supporting actors hit their marks, the confused husband of billy crudup, the controlling neighbor played by kristen wiig not too much from the bridesmaid character, and wise friendship of laurence fishburne are all good, with really the daughter becky being the next outstanding performance of the bunch (troian bellisario ) who is integrated into the films. yet, it's really the focus on cate managing to portray that storm that is mental illness that impressed this writer, not only in physical mannerisms, but even the pressured speech, the inconsistency, and more so the denial of handling the problems that gave me respect for the role. past the pillar of performances, the movie is a cute film that captures the spirit of the book (or what i have read of it) taking good morals about creativity, finding one self, love, and understanding and managing to smoosh it together into a rather audience friendly form that groups can enjoy. it's pace is okay, i think perfect for the key audience members, to really get the snapshots of bernadette's journey without being dragged into the detailed pits of despair that sometimes are seen in these profile movies. yet it is missing something that some book movies achieve so well. and of course, who would not like to see some fun tributes and use of icon legend cyndi lauper come into play that's a hoot right?while the portrayals and the performances are nice though there is something about this movie that is a little too bookish for me. i love reading, but books give you that ability to spread the journey across time while movies are not quite that luxury and this movie emphasizes the point for me. the melodramatic components of this film make for a great performance, but overshadow a lot of other features of this film, almost taking the lifetime approach without the pregnancy, murder, or adultery. for a comedy, the movie did not quite have the balance of laughs i know cate can pull off, relying a little too much on the dryer sarcasm than anything else, which i think only hits a finite audience. yet the things about this book that get me are more so the inclusion of the other characters. for a movie about essentially about reconnecting, to the world, the inclusion of the cast is not as good as i expected. despite decent performances, characters are limited to small bouts of banter with the main character, or merely just making appearances in shots in a hasty attempt to concise the healing process. other plot points including rivalries, cleaning up her mistakes, and even a particular gossip rival are swept to the sidelines to keep the focus on the journey to beautiful shots galore of the antarctic peninsula. as such, i would have liked better connections than what i got. however, for a title and trailer that suggest mystery, this tale has practically no mystery whatsoever. in an attempt to either parody or touch gone girl, bernadette's journey offers no real challenge to the audience or the characters about where the titular character has gone. you know every step of the journey and thus that aspect is essentially lost to the attempts to do the character connection mentioned earlier. finally, the ending, when all is said and done, and the \"mystery\" is concluding, the film sort of truncates the potential for an emotionally powerful finish and leaves you with a montage that while interesting is not the ending i had expected. if this is how the book does, i might have taken another 15 minutes of creative liberty to give a fitting end, but hey that's just me.the verdict:truth be told, this movie is a stunning example of how performances can sometimes do a lot of heavy lifting and while not my favorite role, cate really leads the charge in this near one woman show. the movie again feels like a book, managing to keep a finger on the pulse of reality/book, and fill it with the cute, heartwarming, moral-filled lessons we love. yet, the flair for the dramatic components, alongside a disjointed attempt at deep character connections/development just did not have that story push i love. too much happening in too short of a time and a mystery that was ironically missing, the visual tribute to bernadette's story is not one of the best adaptations for most audiences looking for this type of movie. as such, i think this movie is reserved to theater visits for a small few, and would have been better on the lifetime channel, or own as a made for tv movie. my scores for this film are:comedy/drama/mystery: 6.5 movie overall: 5.0", "this is a taken from a nice true story; it's about a woman who might seem a bit bizarre and get to be considered really sick and crazy for some misunderstandings and errors, but is able to get herself out in a brilliant way and thanks to her daughter. plot takes place in seattle and the antarctic.", "cate blanchett really seems to relish these sort of quirky characters. you can feel the joy she puts into this role. a family comedy about an eccentric woman whose daughter is about to leave for boarding school. definitely one of the better films i have seen this year. the south pole trip is spectacular ! bet nice cast had a blast making the movie. not your everyday storyline either. i recommend watching some interviews with the cast online after to gain a better understanding of the characters. gonna get the book.", "this one is a special kind, different story line and presents other side of the reality. i wasn't bored for a single second and didn't even fast forwarded it. i just didn't wanna miss anything.#irecommendtowatch", "during the first 4/5 of this film, i kept thinking, \"where is the material?\" the script was so trite, superficial, or cliched, that it seemed like a series of pretty scenes held together by a thin plot. finally, well over the half way point, it got into some genuine material, greatly aided by scenes of antarctica (not all filmed there) and bernadette's stumbling upon a worthwhile purpose for her life going forward. this brought out her talents and her ability to live a meaningful life again. the first part of the film was just about her shallow conversations with friends and family. i was really interested when she committed herself to a challenging project in antarctica, but before that, her character didn't convince me that she was talented, wealthy, or willing to face life. this film only reaches a rating of 3 because the last part is substantial: the first part deserves a 1. if you don't want to sit through most of it, you may walk out early. a few surprising exceptions to the poor script were the credibility of the therapist and the honesty of her former architecture colleague. the scenes with her daughter were really lacking, as her daughter's lines were precocious. thank goodness at least bernadette's husband had a sense for helping his daughter grow up with integrity.", "i found the story to be touching and sweet. i don't want to spoil anything, so i won't go into detail, but i my friends and i enjoyed the movie very much. cate blanchett was brilliant, as always, and i loved kristen wiig and laurence fishburn's characters too. i thought all of the main characters were believable and relatable.", "i admit that i inly watched this because of cate blanchett, which says a lot about her acting resume. if you aren't a fan of cate then you might hate this because, well, this film is all cate.her acting style is well suited to this role as she plays haughty, snobbish older women very well. however, there is a poshness and eccentricity that she brings to this role that doesn't quite fit in with the vibe of the rest of the cast. cate is this rambling, out-of-touch older woman among a society of younger middle class suburbanites who exist within clean, sanitized bubbles of comfort. the two worlds do not mesh well.however, this contrast also means the energy of this movie is unlike anything i've ever seen. it feels very old and new at the same time, and in that way it's completely unique. especially the story. aging suburban mom loses her mind, flees her family and takes a trip to antarctica where she is assigned an architecture project. there is a lot here that i felt was imaginative and experimental.i can see why people would be confused by this movie. at first i wasn't sure how all the elements worked together but over time bernadette's past is explained in better detail and it all comes together as a cohesive thing, even if it's entirely unrelatable.bernadette's husband, daughter and pretty much everyone else in this movie were unlikeable to me because they lack the depth and eccentricity that cate provides. they are basically suburban drones who live in comfort bubbles whilst demonizing any person or thing that may challenge that narrative. bernadette happens represent the type of person they scorn, so in that sense their family unit and her greater existence in the community doesn't quite make sense.fun to watch for its freshness but ultimately a bit disjointed and strange to be relatable to a larger audience.", "oh dear dear, what a disappointment, i watched this thinking and hoping to see another great performance by cate blanchett but instead got treated to a what can only be described as a \"whitehall farce\" and an attempt to recreate slap stick comedy. all out of date and cate trying out her \"american\" accent and failing badly does not help. i can't help wondering why she ever degraded her career bu accepting this. perhaps towards the end it gets a little better but that is only thanks to the scenery.", "this tells the story of a family that needs a big dose of love and understanding. the journey of getting to the end is possibly far fetched, but it works. it is engaging and touches heart strings. i find it entertaining and engaging.", "painfully real, humorous, poignant in so many ways. a woman's journey through her life and all its challenges. the many interpretations of the heroines' predicaments, are so true, meaningful. how different people attempt to help!", "definitely better than the reviews. i would the only problem i have is with the writing behind bills character he's a bit short lived but other than that it's a great family film or even for a rainy day.", "i did not like the book upon reading it, so i was a bit skeptical at watching the movie.cate blanchett did a fabulous job and the emotions of the mother - daughter relationship were played perfectly!don't miss it!", "rarely will you ever find a movie with a cast that works so seamlessly together. my god, they must have rehearsed forever. i got lost inside the performances unable to recognize the screen had borders. i felt like i was functioning as the camera, recording, experiencing, reacting. sometimes it was uncomfortable sharing her family's travails, at other times i was privy to the fun a real family can experience when their emotions are genuine. i cheered, outwardly, actually, verbally! i've never done that. and, i wept tears, real tears, i was a soggy mess by the end of the movie. it was a very good movie. even if you don't share what i shared you will appreciate what great acting and filmmaking can do for your soul. i thank everyone associated with this fine film; well done! ...i've also never done that before either...", "i think this movie had so much pottential but it didn't go well :/ however,it still make your heart warm.also cate blanchett rocks!!", "i love how the movie felt like the book.. love cate and her impeccable facial expressions and acting. great casting. enjoyed it a lot. go see it!", "greetings again from the darkness. has she lost her way or lost her mind? the bernadette fox we meet is a misanthrope. she doesn't much like her life. it's a life with a loving husband, a workaholic tech genius. it's a life with a crumbling, once majestic mansion that she is remodeling one spot at a time. it's a life with a smart daughter who admires her mother. it's a life that expects participation at a level bernadette is unwilling to commit. and it's a life that is not the one she envisioned for herself.two time oscar winner cate blanchett plays bernadette, and as with most of her roles, she embodies the character. it's a role that more resembles that of her character in blue jasmine than in carol. bernadette is not really a likeable person and she clearly feels out of place in suburbia ... yet we find her interesting - in a train wreck kind of way. she's a bit reclusive and seems to best communicate with manjula, her virtual assistant in india. the daily dictations come across as therapy as much as directives for such vitals as fishing vests.bernadette describes herself as a \"creative problem solver with good taste\" and as the self-proclaimed \"b**** goddess of architecture\". a mid-life crisis is pretty easy to recognize (unless it's your own). it's rarely about the person you sleep next to, and often about \"finding one's true self\". this syndrome is especially irksome for a parent, and is actually better described as selfish behavior. bernadette was a rising star in the los angeles world of architecture, and when microsoft bought her husband elgie's (billy crudup) software, the couple relocated to seattle where he could continue his high-tech pursuits. bernadette stopped designing and focused on being a mother to daughter (and the film's narrator) bee (emma nelson). in fact, it's bee's request for a family trip to antarctica that pushes bernadette to the brink.the supporting cast is brimming with talent. kristin wiig is audrey, the neighbor and private school mom who manages to push every wrong button for bernadette. audrey is a victim of bernadette's mean streak in one of the more outrageous scenes in the film. zoe chao is audrey's friend and elgie's new administrative assistant. laurence fishburne appears as bernadette's mentor, and judy greer is underutilized in the role of psychologist. others you'll recognize include james urbaniak, claudia doumit, and megan mullaly. but despite all of that talent, this is cate blanchett's (and bernadette's) movie. is it a powerful performance or an overpowering one? i'm still not sure.what is certain is that the production design of bruce curtis is exceptional. the old mansion is worthy of its own story, and provides a distinct contrast to audrey's spit-shined coziness next door. the scenes on the ships at sea are also well done, and bernadette in the kayak makes for an absolute stunning visual.of course the film is based on the 2012 best-selling novel by maria semple, and director richard linklater co-wrote the script with his me and orson welles collaborators of holly gent and vincent palmo. we typically discuss how an actor might be miscast, but this time the debate could be in regards to the director. mr. linklater is a wonderful director with such diverse films as boyhood (2014), bernie (2011), before sunrise (1995) and dazed and confused (1994). he's a naturalistic story-teller with personalities we recognize. bernadette looms so larger-than-life, with her grandiose gestures and over-dramatizing every moment that she's almost cartoonish at times. at times, linklater seems like everyone else ... not sure what to make of bernadette.the film differs in many details from the novel, but the spirit remains. this plays like 'diary of a mad-disgruntled-unfulfilled housewife', and it's obvious to viewers that bernadette's near seclusion is actually her hiding from herself. ms. blanchett is a marvelous actress, one of the best of all-time. she is set to play the legendary lucille ball in aaron sorkin's planned lucy & desi film. ms. blanchett commands our attention for bernadette, whether it's in the comedy segments or the more philosophical moments. rarely will you see a film whose act i and act iii are so tonally opposite. the first part plays like an old-fashioned howard hawks comedy, while the last part is bernadette's more somber search for artistic expression once she is freed from the constraints of family life. it's the saddest comedy i can recall.", "i laughed 1 time the entire movie....and i actually wanted to see this. i did not read the book, so perhaps that held back my enjoyment of bernadette. cate blanchette was quite uneven and poor kristen wiig was wasted in her role. horrific editing. pass on this unless you are a huge fan of the book and just want to see what they did...they created a mess.", "former star architect bernadette fox (cate blanchett) is a troubled woman in seattle. her only friend is her teen daughter bee. her husband elgie branch (billy crudup) is a tech genius who got rich selling to microsoft. she has a cantankerous relationship with her neighbor audrey griffin (kristen wiig) over a hillside full of blackberry. she is troubled by a planned family trip to antarctica.i'm mostly interested in this for director richard linklater. the cast also seems interesting. i don't know anything about this movie. at first, i'm unsure about bernadette. it's not easy to like her. her story is a mystery until a few scenes of constant expositions. there has to be an easier way to reveal her past at an earlier stage. when bernadette leaps out of the bathroom window, i assumed the story would go one way but it goes slightly wrong. her obvious motivation is to find bee and go to her. that's her only reasonable move. it doesn't make sense for her to board a plane and then a boat without knowing first that bee is onboard. why go to antarctica? the math does not add up. of course, i remember something about the new south pole structures and i highly doubt this is anything close to the real story. in which case, they need to rework the story. it makes more sense for bernadette to be pursuing bee to antarctica. a lot would have to be reconfigured but it is very much needed.", "the film isn't bad, just forgettable. it has it's moments but all in all they feel trivial. perhaps it's the story - a very simplistic modern fairy-tale - that makes it feel shallow. though i liked the characters i didn't really care for them, and because of that quite a few scenes felt tedious. actually even stopped watching the trailer for the film the day before, because it was so boring that started to wonder if the trailers have to be so long. 30-60 seconds should be enough to give a glimpse. anyway. still went to see the film because, you know, linklater. didn't really feel like his work though.", "not a bad movie, but the book was better. isn't the book always better? it felt rushed to me. i think if more time we're taken to flesh out bernadette's character, the movie would make more sense.", "a tidy tale of mental illness? or a manic meditation on motherhood/parenthood? perhaps neither, or perhaps both...but even when i felt emotionally manipulated while watching this i was more than willing to go along, thanks to linklater and the stellar crew.long ago, i've felt the spark of creativity gets ignited in some of the darker places of the soul. my fuse is mostly spent at this point, but nice to see bernadette looking for hers in this clear, well-lighted movie.", "long, drawn out, poorly acted nothingness. not worth the time.", "saw a little bit of somebody in every character. pretty much a feel good movie. loved the family. loved that it wasn't typical in any way. not for everyone, like people who thought once upon a time in hollywood was funny. no nudity, no violence. some of us like that. beautiful cinematography in antarctica!", "i looked up this film because i was curious how kristen wiig does in a feature film. i heard of her comical stunts, but in this film she's not being funny at all. however she does a very good job, given her adaptability. the big bonus was the performance of cate blanchet - complex, deep, likeable... still, the way they advertise the film as being among other things a comedy, is off-placed. there is nothing comical about this film, and some witty lines, although enjoyable, don't mean comedy. it would have been a very nice family film if it weren't for the child who, at some point, is effing out. and her mother is like \"you are super-cool!\" that was a shock from which you cannot recover fully until the end of the film. why did they have to ruin a good film like that? is this the first high-end film where a child swears like that?", "didnt really understood the plot of this movie. only good part was cate's acting. i tried to understand the meaning of the movie but i guess thats going to stay as a mystery for me", "where'd you go bernadettea very well written movie and brilliantly carried off by cate blanchet, yes there were some super contrived moments but basically it was about an artist who had lost her mojo after several personal tragedies.it wasn't funny on any level really and comedy is not cate's forte.the film was stuffed with stars that brought this up to a firm 6 out of 10, good movie watch this, won't win any awards.", "the first hour is very tightly plotted, closely observed and very funny in places. kristin wiig and cate blanchett play very well off each other and provide most of the pleasure. billy crudup and emma nelson give good support to blanchett. then things start to go off the rails. i haven't read the novel so i can't say if the fault lies there, but i do know that once seattle is left behind the story falters. it's a shame because the material was so good.", "i was so looking forward to watching this movie, only to be disappointed by the adaptation. i usually can understand poetic license between screen and print, but this was such a departure it was difficult to get involved with the characters as completely as while reading the book.", "boring compared with the book. why is the daughter made to be so self-righteous? i didn't like her character at all. i think much more could have been done to make the movie visually appealing and funny. the book was entertaining because it was witty and just a bit absurd. the movie is a bit dumb.", "if you believe you are a creator than this film is for you. especially if you're one that has ever lost their spark or motivation. it's a beautiful story of recapturing what makes you whole. i don't ever understand when movies like this get harsh criticism, it's feel-good at it's finest. it's quirky, genuine and full of inspiration.", "i like the idea of this better than the result. i'm not talking so much about the book it's based on, which i haven't read, either. rather, \"where'd you go, bernadette\" is a conceptually promising picture because it's about the artist inhabiting places, and that artist is an architect who designs spaces. think of all the architecturally great films throughout history; from the production design of art cinema, often labelled, appropriately or not, as \"expressionism,\" from weimar germany; to what a trained architect and engineer like sergei eisenstein was able to develop with montage; alfred hitchcock with the camera; the weaving of architectural and narrative structure in, say, \"last year at marienbad\" (1961) or of modernist commentary in \"playtime\" (1967). point is, there's a lot that has been and could be done architecturally with cinema--all the better when the content of the picture is reflexively about the same thing. but, alas, \"where'd you go, bernadette\" is lacking the visual and narrative artistry that its story of an artist calls for.although i haven't read it, the book i understand is in the epistolary form, so stylistically it reflects its own construction, its own creation. having studied gothic horror novels, which frequently have an epistolary plot comprised of letters, diary entries, voice recordings and so on, especially bram stoker's \"dracula,\" and, then, seeing a bunch of the filmic adaptations, i know very well how poorly such novelistic construction translates to cinema. some alternative directions are flirted with here, though. there's the film-within-the-film that's a video documentary about the artist, bernadette fox (as played by cate blanchett). her daughter narrates by voiceover, and bernadette monologues for electronic messages. all techniques calling attention to the picture's artificiality.better yet, bernadette's story arc revolves around the spaces she inhabits: her initial genius and ultimate set back in los angeles, her breakdown in seattle (this technology hub of a metropolis doesn't come off well here), and her revival in antarctica. all involve buildings she designs. this works best with the pettiness between her and a neighbor (an always good, but underused kristen wiig), which results in a mudslide breaking through the neighbor's home. at its worst, though, are scenes supposedly in antarctica, but which were filmed in greenland and some of which look no better than green-screen composites--especially the two-shot outside between the father and daughter. it's hideous, and it doesn't help, either, that the narrative at this point becomes incessantly cloying in its rushed and overly sanguine resolution.oh well, even though there's no genius with the camera here or the narrative structure, despite a director, richard linklater, who has a good track record otherwise, and a character in the movie who it's pointed out numerous times is an \"artist\" and \"genius,\" at least the actress playing the protagonist at the center of it all is one of the best at inhabiting characters and occupying space on screen. blanchett always raises the quality of any project she's in. this time, she's given a decent look of an eccentric recluse, and she rattles off some amusing, breathless rants with occasional five-dollar words thrown in for good measure. it's disappointing, however, that she doesn't receive the structural support she and her character deserve. it's not that this is a bad movie, per se--not entirely, at least; it's just that it could've been great, but isn't.", "really odd film. surprised those actors involved agreed to do it . pretty awful film", "it's fabulous and very touching. cate is amazing once again. it's true it is master linklater's least creative effort, but it delivers powerful statements on family values and perseverance. a crowd pleasing mainstream flick, cynically funny and timely.", "cate blanchett plays bernadette, a wife and loving mother who has rather lost her way in life. originally a famous, award winning architect, she has devoted her life to motherhood and running a home. however, giving up a key, creative part of her life has left scars and turned her into a sometime shut off, bitter individual. when her daughter asks if the family can go on holiday to antarctica, to help with a school project, the extremely reluctant traveller agrees, not realising the impact it will have on her.an odd, somewhat eccentric, even fairy tale look at the pitfalls of changes in life, in this case, giving up something you love and not really acknowledging it. it is as they say in many reviews - 'quirky' - which makes for ideal fodder for arguably the best film actress on the planet, who clearly relishes the often over the top, eccentric, sometimes annoying and even sometimes unbelievable character. nicely offset then by emma nelson as the loving daughter who doesn't entirely see the issue and especially by billy crudup who does and is desperate to find a solution. suspend any disbelief you may have and enjoy.", "this is definitely the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life. i'm in disbelief that how cate blanchett could accept to act in this film. very weak storytelling. feels like they made the film over a weekend. i feel bad for the cinema.", "wish we all could run away as adults. rather watch this than ad astra.", "an unusual story about an anti social architect, perceived by her husband as having some sort of breakdown.i like cate blanchett, she does a decent job here, but the story is a little too quirky.the film is different, not a run of the mill storyline (which is a good thing), and overall the film is fine, but not great.no real need to catch this one.", "i absolutely loved the novel, and i think it's greatest strength was how the story was told mainly through letters, emails and documents. this format does not lend itself to film, unfortunately, which meant that a great deal of the charm was lost. the film also left out a great deal of the suspense of the novel, spelling out main plot points early on. the majority of the film focuses on what is only about the last quarter of the novel, meaning that some scenes seem drawn out while major plot points seem rushed. the characters also suffer, as the format does not allow for all of the idiosyncrasies and quirks that made the characters so endearing to be portrayed. the actors do a phenomenal job, but at the end of the day, this novel does not lend itself to film very well.", "i haven't seen blinded by the light yet, but just leave it to linklater to make the best film so far of august. i know some people that this film would be an easy recommendation for. while watching this, i was thinking i never want to rewatch this, just because it's not entirely my film. but it's inspirational. what else did you expect from a linklater film. i enjoyed it a bit more than boyhood. this film isn't linklater's best, it's your typical festival-fare. although, i liked it a lot more than something like maude (starring linklater's favourite leading actor ethan hawke). i've seen some critically praised films worse than this in 2019 (captain marvel, hobbs and shaw, the dead centre). this could've been a hallmark special, but because linklater generally loves humanity, and is always experimenting, this film is quite watchable, it's warm, relatable, and modest, and i wasn't asking for much else, after doing a 10km run to the theatre.", "linklater understands to show the restricted perspective of people in a charming and loving way, without reducing the characters to a cliché. the movie shows how you can get caught up in stuff and think there's no way out, until you realise that you'll just have to start walking the other way.", "must see 6/10oh my gosh. read the book (yes, it comes from a book) then watch this movie. the story is very rich with layers of quirkiness that doesn't translate well to a different but the movie does a great job of trying to get them all in. but if you have read the book before then you will understand the gaps in the movie better.beautifully cast and shot.a definite must see after you read the book", "expected a lot from this movie, because i adore cate blanchett as an actress. billy crudup always bored me to death though in other movies, but since he played the role of a (boring) husband he was typecasted perfectly.the bad: there is no spark or punch. this story toddles along. it's basically quite tedious. there are no great jokes. they have put in a lot of subtle, nuanced \"jokes\", but they never really hit the mark. there is no drama. no suspense. no surprising plot turns.any good? well it toddles along nicely. for those who want a no thrill story about a mom going on a cruise, this is your pick.", "i was apprehensive going into the theater after watching the trailers. the movie played an interesting take on the book in that it immediately displayed where bernadette went (versus the book in which the whereabouts of the aloof bernadette remained a secret until the end). there were many other small plot changes in the movie which occurred in the book that left out pivotal events, causing some confusion in the audience. reading the book proved beneficial in that i was able to fill in the blanks from what the movie left out. however, i don't believe that only people who read the book will enjoy the film, for my friends who accompanied me and were unaware of the plotline before the movie, loved every second. we shared both laughter and tears from this delightful story. in linklater fashion, i felt connected with the characters as if i've known them my whole life. the development in bernadette's attitude towards life and her passions made me feel excited for her, encouraging me to do the same in chasing my own creative outlet. sure, i would deem \"where'd you go, bernadette\" a feel-good movie. if you have not seen the film yet, i highly encourage you to do so. if you're looking for an exact re-enactment of the book, this is not it. the movie is special and unique on its own, watch it for yourself instead of trusting random user's reviews.", "whered you go bernadette is film that is worth to see just becase blanchett performance she had far better roles before but even here she was best part,and rest of film is forgetable and rest of cast was boring and unintersting in potreying their characters,expecely daughter who in most scenes with her annoyed me with her smugness and attitude,also husband was so unlikeable and weakminded that it was also frustrating to listen him,hell i dont remember film with so unlikeable characters,kristen wigg was given to little screentime to show her talent and it felt flat,this film is very forgetable film in the end and it didnt worth blanchett talent and presance", "if you've seen blue jasmine, then watching cate blanchette head towards a breakdown due to a mental illness left untreated will be a familiar viewing experience for you. your fandom of that film will probably go a long way towards judging your enjoyment of this film, as this is essentially a cate blanchette showcase.bernadette is treated as more of a dark comedy than a serious drama, which does add some more entertainment into the mix, but at the same time lessens the emotional impact and pathos of the characters. the middle third of the movie with the introduction of the therapist and trying to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with bernadette dragged on unnecessarily, but a strong start and ending make it worth a watch.", "this film could have been a

the novel. there are so many important little details that aren't present - a lot of meaningful stuff is lost. and events happen so quickly in order to cram the most important ones into 1.75 hours, sometimes things seem out of nowhere and like they don't really make sense. they also completely got rid of the most suspenseful event - the climax was so anticlimactic for me and i don't know if it's because i'd read the book or if it would be that way regardless because they got rid of the entire mystery.maybe people who haven't read the book would enjoy the film more - feeling less picky about the missing/altered details. but then the mystery is given away and that's a really enjoyable part of the book, which is why i say read it first. maybe read it and then watch the film a year later when you've forgotten the details anyway, all that said...the meaning behind the story is still there and i still really liked it. cate blanchett is wonderful to watch too. it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a burnt out mother who feels like you've lost herself and even more especially if part of that is because you have a sick or disabled child. but you'll relate more to the book than the film since they spend next to no time on bernadette's backstory in the movie.", "the man behind bernie and boyhood richard linklater directs and co-writes, where'd you go bernadette - adapted from maria semple's novel with the same name.bernadette is a vibrant, loving wife and mother to her husband and daughter, ensuring their needs are prioritised ahead of her crowded work life in art design. though, a 'volta' moment in her existence makes her reflect on her past, and consider her future, causing her to free herself from the complications and normalities of everyday life.kristen wiig, laurence fishburne and judy greer feature in significant roles that alter the film's protagonist's emotions, and it is cate blanchett who steals the show with a passionate, convincing performance encapsulating her character's frustrations and willingness to explore more of the world. throughout the film we almost see an evolution of bernadette, as she develops across the course she seemingly displays an increasing urge to release the ties holding her back, the people around her, her family, her work all become problematic in her life - and ultimately, we see this evolution hit breaking point and the tone and rhythm of the picture change completely.the film's premise is one that gathers a slow-moving pace and one with little input of shock or mystery - as film fans we must appreciate movies with little action but a flowing script as much as a casual script with an abundance of thrill - where'd you go bernadette allows us as the audience to evaluate our surroundings, work, family, friends and question our satisfaction.much like the main character, the watch appears to miss something, allowing it to fly high. instead, it can be perceived as quiet and slightly lackadaisical. nevertheless, blanchett shines as a consolation.", "i found this film to touching, and very redeeming. granted, it's tough to get there as you wonder why is cate blanchett's character so off-putting and strange... but if you stick with it you will suddenly empathize and feel so sympathetic for her character. i actually think this is one of the best films i've seen this year.", "based on a noted book. the story is grandiosing and amusing. seems to a tv movie for preteen girls. a bit crazy and outlandish. could be happening in the future. has a feel of hyperrealism. the contrary of a superhero film. interesting!", "a movie about educated wealthy people . who cares ? can anyone relate to this bs? a movie about personal issues being resolved throughout the plot! not interesting at all . one star for production one star for acting one star for movie grip .", "twenty years ago, cate blanchett was a leading architect in los angeles. she had just won a macarthur grant. something went wrong with something called \"the 20-mile house\" and she vanished. well, she moved with husband billy crudup (who's looking more and more like willem dafoe) to seattle, where he's got a project with microsoft that encompasses mindreading, while she raises their daughter and has alienated all the neighbors. kristen wiig, a stepford mother is complaining that the raspberries from blanchett's house is invading her property, so cate tells her to have her guy deal with it. then she runs over miss wiig's foot, and during the next storm, the entire hill comes into the wiig household. when crudup tries an intervention with a psychiatrist, she vanishes again.it's a movie to watch miss blanchett do the sort of juicy acting that all performers wish for, loving mother and absolute fruitcake that has the fbi computer crimes division calling about a russian identity theft ring, ranging from seattle to antarctica, with laurence fishburn as her mentor to explain just what's going on. miss blanchett looks to be going for her seventh oscar nomination and third win. i'm sure she'll get the former, but we'll see about the actual win. meryl streep as marmee in little

in the geography of the narrative, in the nature of the main character, in effectiveness of execution. i cannot forgive the bad, patronising humour that opens the show, the over-long introduction and the absurd cameos by a host of what the main character accurately describes as \"gnats\". but survive that and the vista opens up into an electifying ride of discovery. blanchette is fabulous at playing brilliant and awkward at pretending semi-normality. her luminous energy well befits the over-achiever but tends to feel like over-eating the scenery otherwise. i still loved the spirit of the film so, if you struggle at the start, your perseverence will be rewarded. it's beautiful to look. that's for sure.", "i've only seen linklater's sunrise/sunset series and really enjoyed them. they're movies only about dialogue and essentially no story.i saw this one a whim as my partner wanted to see it, though i heard the mixed stuff and wasn't gonna bother.safe to say it is a mediocre outing. it has some really great moments and could have been so much better, but i couldn't help but think that the movie felt like an early version of the script.blanchett is definitely the best part of the movie. she does a great job balancing being a stuck up woman who is also extremely likable at the same time being a really great and loving mother. the interactions between her and her daughter are the best moments of the movie. the two of the have great mother/daughter chemistry.i also really like the premise of her character. she's a former architect who left her creative love after she married a man who worked out of seattle and had a kid together. she's been out of her art creation for over a decade and he doesn't know what to do with herself.the part where she runs away happens way too late in the movie for a movie titled \"where'd you go....\" it happens 3/4ths of the way through and the epiphany she reaches seems really rushed.it's a decent indie feeling movie with a great performance by blanchett and the first time actress who plays her daughter. i just wish the story was a bit more cohesive and the disappearance happened earlier so we can see her change and come to the realization that she needs to rediscover her love of creating.", "gorgeous film about re discovery! love the mother, daughter bond and the story is just great.. excellent movie!cate as always is extraordinary!", "couldn't make head or tail of this film. just what was it trying to do, what was its point? scene followed scene without any clear connection with what came before or what was to come. bernadette did not come over as a sympathetic character, rather it was those who had to put up with her that had my sympathy. avoid unless you like movies that are a mess.", "we went to see this film for an impromptu night out. my wife had read the book , but couldn't remember it, and i knew nothing about it.the acting was ok, the dialog was ok - but with a reliance on monologues and characters watching tv or dvds. overall it was ok and passed an evening after a good meal.the worst features were that the first third of the film was boring and unmotivated - we both agreed afterwards that we were independently thinking \"why are we watching this?\" at that point - and that the plot is just daft. the storyline felt as if it were a string of second rate sitcom epoisodes loosley strung together.", "this film was a good night's entertainment. it had it's funny moments, sad moments and everything in between. i think many of us can see a bit of ourselves in the main character. it's nice to see a movie show the not-so-perfect side of neighbors, marriage and parenthood in a funny kind of way. cate blanchette is very versatile and was perfect for this role.", "with a release date pushed, little to no marketing, or promotion from its stars or director, i didn't have much confidence in this film to be of great quality. to no one's surprise, it ultimately isn't. what is more or less a boring, bland, green screen filled mystery about why bernadette leaves her family, the film is stuck in mediocrity. even with all the talent involved, it never exceeds in distancing itself from the rest of the pack, thus why the film failed at the box office.5.1/10", "i thought it may be good....it was great!there should be more movies like this...maybe people would not be so bitter. it brings out everything that just about everyone loves....the meaning of family, love, fighting to the bitter end for something you believe in. at times you will laugh, be sad and maybe even a little upset but everything circles back....it all ties together and makes sense. it leaves you with a good feeling.if you choose to watch this movie i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.", "\"where'd you go bernadette\" is a touching story at the core, but is overall empty and can sometimes be dull.in this comedy-drama, a woman takes a leap of faith and winds up on an adventure of rediscovery.if it wasn't for cate blanchett's star power and performance, i don't know where this film would stand. a very interesting film for director richard linklater (\"boyhood\", \"everybody wants some!!\", \"last flag flying\") to follow his string of powerful and moving pictures. the real deal in \"where'd you go, bernadette\" is new actress emma nelson who has a bright future ahead; remember that name. this film could've been better but it's another summer disappointment.", "another underrated non-mainstream film.in an era dominated by cynicism and excessive analysis, the need for more films addressing the complexities of our lives has never been more apparent. our society tends to overmedicalize, sending children to the doctor for every minor ailment, often resulting in misdiagnoses. this trend extends to adults as well, as the true nature of genius remains widely misunderstood. there is a prevailing notion that conventional career paths and climbing the corporate ladder are the only acceptable routes; and deviating from this norm is frowned upon. we need more movies shedding light on individuals who make decisions divergent from the mainstream, yet with compelling reasons behind them. only the magnificent cate blanchett could pull off this complex role.a notable flaw in the movie lies in its opening. the lack of a well-crafted introduction diminishes the audience's ability to connect with her character. there is a lack of connection from the supporting cast, as she stands apart in a way that doesn't necessarily enhance the viewing experience positively. but the movie is worth viewing. there should be more movies like this one.", "i guess the book was better. the movie was okay, but it lacked so many things. first of all, the main character was not well esplained. sure, she was quirky and odd, but there was a reason for it, that was only mentioned towards the ending. the story itself was not well presented and ended up being a bit boring and nothing special. bernadette's past was only seen through cracks here and there. overall, it was wasted potential.", "i love cate blanchett in this film as well as many others! this story i thought would be quite entertaining from the trailer's standpoint which was very intriguing. i am a \"old movie\" lover and the quality of a story these days in modern day movies is few and far between. the character development and points of view was phenomenal. narrated from the daughter but caught the perception of the mother as well as the father equally. i loved and adored the uniqueness of the character \"bernadette\". she had an incredible back story that was entirely relate-able to many different kinds of women. i am personally an artist and i could relate to the statement \" if you are an artist that doesn't create, you become a menace to society\". its a great film to watch as a family as well as going out for a mother/daughter date. i will more than likely buy this on dvd when it comes out as i have went to the theater twice to see it so far. i actually would love to read the book on this one and get further enjoyment out of it! i also noticed that the author of the book was the producer in this film. that made me happy to know she had some sort of a hand in the movie about her novel. this is a must see and could potentially get overlooked and underrated. i adore this movie.", "speaking as someone who's been to the antarctic peninsula, the filmmakers got the look and feel of the continent (and the ships that travel there) exactly right.and as someone who loved the book, i was prepared to be disappointed after reading a number of middling-to-bad reviews in the paper and online.this is a wonderful story, well-told, with a lot of heart.

were annoying.", "sort of went into this movie knowing i had other stuff to do, but every time i went to get up, another little twist kept my interest...until lastly, i just fell in love with the ending, and it tied up all the loose ends in a beautiful bow...don't give up on this!", "i give it a 2 rating because the daughter (troian bellisario) was terrific. but there is nothing in this movie that warrants watching. i saw it because my wife said the previews on tv made it look like there might be some funny parts. it's not close to being a comedy. the main character is incredibly unlikeable and we don't care if anything happens to her. she supposedly suffers from a mental illness, but that's not talked about until half the movie is over. then a curve-ball is thrown where her online shopping is actually a front for a terrorist operation and the fbi gets involved. this lasted about for about 10 minutes in the movie. that would have been a great story, but the story of where she disappeared to was only the last 20 minutes. sorry, don't waste your time. guessing ms blanchett thought it would be nice to do something other than drama. but this was just not a good script, so no blame to her. and unfortunately for mr. crudup, whom i think is a terrific actor, but his part was nothing as well. heck, due to this horrible script, anyone could have played his part. again, not the actors fault. all in all, one of those movies where you say to yourself \"how did this get approved by anyone at a major studio?\" what about this script made anyone at a studio say \"yes, let's make a movie about an unlikeable main character that no one cares about and no one cares \"where\" she went.\"", "we don't know everyone's journey. even though this wasn't based on a true story; it

6...score. cate is superb as usual and lends the perfect amount of quirky ness to the lead role. a true look at the untapped under potential of genius, anyone who feels like a ghost, just floating thru life will be inspired to remember who they are meant to be.", "the best part is mrs. blanchett's performance, as always a pleasure. the rest uninspiring and a strange mix of drama, comedy and

something i (and i being an extreme introvert) can truly understand. i feel this movie is very humorous (again from the standpoint of an introvert). the solution to bernadette's problem (that i won't mention) is what she was born to do which finally gives her peace along with removing her issues.", "i desperately wished for a fast forward for acts i and ii. act three was marginally entertaining.

husband who thinks she needs help, and a supportive daughter. she goes on an adventure to self discover herself.it is a self discovery kind of movie. where one character feels like she is missing out on opportunities that she was passionate about. her meds was not helping.however, the film is boring. it is not as funny. the characters are dull. the first hour is spent with bernadette dealing with her needy, obsessed, and frustrating neighbor played by kristen wiig. the script feels hollow with the plot and characters.overall, where'd you go, bernadette is a boring movie that has a great lead but does not go anywhere with its story.", "the movie is great the story is awesome and no one and i mean it no one would do this disturbed genius portrait as cate blanchett. now the only question in my mind is why such a story and such a performance get only this 6 rate stars! come on ppl stop being negative", "just an ordinary, boring movie. apparently linklater cannot create something outstanding", "for those who call this boring, congratulations. thank you linklater for devoting time to capture a cultural snapshot of a landscape of contradictions and facades. regardless of one's ability to sympathize with bernadette, the ennui, 'seattle freeze', prep-school petty preoccupations and overworked tech family vibes ring true, and the pacing echoes the half asleep versus 'flow' state that the creative class is forced into in the current economy. the fact that this film will appeal to youth and creatives who are barely holding it together in the age of insta and sharenting is a badge of honor. hoping docomowewa geeks and polies will agree that while not perfectly executed, this movie has reminded us to not let the crass grubbers get you down, and to be yourself (and that blackberries are structural entities unto themselves).", "normally i love cate blancette but this is a film is awful. the character is an entitled elitist with endless funds and slaves to do her bidding and frankly i could not care less about her puny meaningless creations and life.on the other hand, a film like this does make me understand the rise of the furious underclasses around the world because the entitled stupidity of this privileged empty headed woman whose only concern is herv own entitled neurosis makes me want to grab a pitchfork and fork her, and i am privileged upper middle class.seriously hollywood, in this day and age of such majorvissues, do better.", "honestly, you would not be able to follow along with the movie of you have not read the book! this movie is a disaster that you cannot follow... the book was a mess and the movie had no storyline to follow.", "i found the advertising for this movie misleading. it indicated that it is a mystery about a disappearance, but the search for the title character (cate blanchett) actually takes up only a small portion of this movie and it really isn't much of a mystery anyway. i would consider this film more of a mid-life crisis story. bernadette fox is a former architect known for her brilliance and eccentricities who, because of a career setback, retired to start a family. her husband elgie branch (billy crudup) is an executive with microsoft in seattle, which bernadette hates, and their daughter bee (emma nelson in her film debut) is about to go east to attend a prestigious prep school. they live in a run-down mansion with a golden retriever named ice cream, and bernadette has an on-line personal assistant from india named manjula whom she has never met in person. for a middle school graduation present, bee wants a family vacation to antarctica. much of the conflict appears to be driven by bernadette's relationship with her next door neighbour, super-soccer mom audrey (kristen wiig), and elgie's administrative assistant (zoe chao), but it is really a result of bernadette's dissatisfaction with her life. elgie realizes this as well and retains the services of a psychiatrist (judy greer) to stage an intervention. blanchett is excellent, as usual, and one reviewer compared her favorably with katharine hepburn in the philadelphia story and bringing up baby. lawrence fishburne has a memorable scene as an old friend and colleague of hers who listens while she vents her emotions. all the other actors are good as well, but the story itself was really rather mundane.", "a work of art; well written, directed, and acted. beautiful scenery and architecture.", "it's *very* hard to dunk yourself out of trumpville these days -- at least without resorting to denial, overheatedness, or overreach -- and here, it's nice to find, there's a whole world going on that parallels things you might see in the visual arts in music that one could surmise will outlast the current static. the key to this film is these are *these* tensions, these weird moments, not so much the usual movie-like situations you can see coming a mile away, and insulate yourself from with the proper distance. that said, every scene is about doling out more information, and the tone is light and keeps things moving without you disliking the characters (again, quite a feat nowadays, unless you're willing to resort to vagaries and irrelevant tensions -- or sexless superheroes in suits they can't *peel* off!). once you've buckled in and settled through a few a scenes and get a sense of the unfolding lay-of-the-land around you, it's really nice. cate blachett is also very sexually attactive, women who crawl around a lot and *do* things are just really apt to give you a little pull inside, i don't know why.", "totally unbelievable. has to be the worst movie cate has ever made.", "i just finished watching yet another award show, the 92nd academy awards makes one

just disappear into oblivion as i'm sure it eventually will. i wish i could unsee this.", "great script and amazing performances by cate blanchet and emma nelson. a human, complex character of a grown woman is usually hard to find, but combined with an offbeat plot is directly a miracle. i sometimes laughed out loud at the clever humour. it should be an oscar movie.", "started off well with showcasing problems of modern life with cate having all sorts of problems because of stretching between her architectural dreams and motherhood, with motherhood sucking the life force out of her, making her thoroughly miserable. showed signs of what unrealistic societal expectations of \"having it all\" can do to a person. but the ending veers off the message and completely scores the wrong point, that somehow everything turns our great in the end, which was totally inconsitent with the overall storyline. the ending left a lot to be desired and with the slow pace of the moving, our whole family dozed off, including the dog."]}

"review_bodies": ["my first milla jovovich movie was ultraviolet, which has spawned more \"worst movie ever\" threads on imdb than any other. well, i wouldn't call it that bad, but still... it hardly gave me any faith in milla's career as a dramatic performer.so i popped this flick in the dvd player not expecting much. sacrée merde! what a surprise. it seems, stripped of her futuristic-mutant-motorcycle-riding-vampire persona, she's really quite good. this film--probably the least glamorous of her entire repertoire--really gives her a chance to show her full dynamics. i can't say much more without giving away the plot, so i'll drop it for now.now on to the director luc besson. for the first half hour or so, he seems to suffer from \"i wanna be kenneth branagh\" syndrome (which is almost as painful as the avian flu). we get a dozen scenes of someone running down a corridor with the camera chasing behind. we get a dozen overhead-camera-twirly shots of someone lying on the ground. we get so many crane shots, you start thinking you're on a construction site. what's wrong with all this? i'll tell you. when the camera swings & sways too much it detracts from the actors' performances. sure it adds visual drama, but so can a good fireworks scene (with just as much subtlety).but suddenly, right around the halfway mark, the camera man simmers down. the whole tone of the film changes, becomes darker and more intense, relying on the power of the actors instead of the gimmicky camera-work. this works brilliantly, especially when dustin hoffman finally steps in.this is the break that takes the movie in an entirely different (and possibly offensive) direction. it looks like some imdb reviewers weren't too happy. i'm sure plenty of others got bored (because the swordfights stop). but me, i thought this change of mood was what made the movie. suddenly it becomes a spooky, psychological thriller with a lot of great dialogue and a ton of good acting. this is the payoff.my biggest gripe with the movie is that after seeing the 2nd half, i kept saying to myself \"why the hell did besson waste so much time getting here?\" there were a few too many insignificant fluff scenes in the beginning (like the virginity test lol) that should have been replaced with more of the powerful milla-dustin dialogue toward the end.i won't comment on historical accuracy, religious sacrilege, lack-of-realism or the fact that there were a few too many american accents for 15th century france. these flaws fall by the wayside if you're instead paying attention to the complex conflict brewing in milla's character. this is really her movie, and a damn good one at that. like my title implies, it's good enough to make me want to give ultraviolet another try.", "luc besson directs and milla jovovich stars as the maid of orleans who lifted france of its knees-and was tried and executed for being a heretic. the end.well that's what you would think all besson's film amounts too, given the hate and general negativity that pours down on it from many of the worlds cinematic sources. well, look, it's not brilliant, but is it really the devil that many have painted it as? not so say i. it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer all told, but besson's study of the iconic/infamous waif who did indeed expel the british hoards has gusto by the shed load. he nicely crafts the 15th century lands from which to tell his story, and then, to quote someone from another period epic, unleashes hell. literally. yep the british armies are stereotypically vile {i bet mel gibson loves the brit portrayals here}, and the blood that is shed is vicious and borderline sick. but it works well in the context of jeanne's prominent rise and subsequent fall, with her religious confliction deftly blending in with the blood being shed in the pursuit of liberation. visually the film is a treat, and for action construction it holds up to be one of the better modern day historical epics in that department. but where's the substance?ah, there's the big problem with the movie. besson and his co-writer andrew birkin are so pre-occupied with the horrors of war and jeanne's leadership qualities, they turn the rest of the film into a skeleton in need of flesh. and it's actually jovovich who suffers the most. she's great when she's screaming and launching into the enemy, taking an arrow hit with grace and dedication . but there's been no character depth laid out, so jovovich's jeanne just comes across as a moody teenager out to cause trouble. we need to have some insight into her troubled predicament and what drives her on, not the scantily written filler moments that actually are just appetisers to blood letting battles. there 's also annoyances when the film slips into moments of modern day speak, it's a crass and lazy oversight by the makers to think that we wouldn't notice such speak in 15th century france. besson surrounds jovovich with some fine acting talent tho, even if some are a tad underused. rolling out are john malkovich, dustin hoffman, faye dunaway, vincent cassel, timothy west, desmond harrington and the always watchable, and scary, tcheky karyo.so a bit hollow it be, but on the outside it's a ripper. visceral, explosive and yes, fun too. 7/10", "if you are wondering about luc besson's vaguely heretical \"the messenger: the story of joan of arc\", try to imagine a cross between \"excalibur\" and \"heaven's gate\". it looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess. there really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to france during the hundred years war. although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. three years after her birth, the new tactics of the english archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at agincourt. the result was credited to henry v's piety and he got a great passage in shakespeare. the french aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the english became solidly entrenched in france. fourteen years later a new generation of french nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the english and their french allies who were having leadership problems. both countries were catholic at the time and both claimed that god was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks god for the victory over another team that apparently god did not favor. although there are records of both of joan's trials (her condemnation trial and her rehabilitation trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with joan's mental condition and visions. there is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation. what hurts \"the messenger: the story of joan of arc\" is that besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. jane valentine is wonderful as the young joan and besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to natalie portman's performance in \"leon\". this early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. imho it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history. and the sequence where the young joan is standing on a hill watching as the english burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.but once milla jovovich's grown-up joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. it's not miscasting, jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see \"the dummy\") rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take besson wanted on joan's personality. the problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young joan, the older joan is just repellent. her story should be inspirational and tragic. instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama. but it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.", "there are many deviations from the accepted facts of jeanne d'arc's life as set out in her trial documentation and the writings of the time. this said, the central question of whether she was a saint, an inspired lunatic, wholly mentally ill, or simply a headstrong girl determined to grab her chances while she could is well asked. many of the comments here assert that besson makes it clear that the maid was simply mentally ill, yet i read the film as deeply ambivalent about what was going on. were her visions the hallucinations of a schizophrenic? were they given by god? what's the difference? more questions are asked: why does an omnipotent, omniscient, all-compassionate deity allow terrible things to happen? what is the meaning of kingship - to own or to serve? what is the difference between taking the lives of individuals and killing en masse? what's the difference between christianity and the earthly institutions of that religion? where does conviction end and fanaticism begin? jovavich's jeanne is plagued by the difference between her idea of utter submission to god and the consequences of doing so; by doubt over the veracity of her visions; and by the gap between her ideals of the divine rights of kings and realpolitik. she is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown - is this a manifestation of her mental illness, or of her \"burning for god\"? and where's the difference between the two?the film raises more questions than it answers, and that's as it should be. it is something of a shame that besson's film takes liberties with the facts as we understand them (though history is more often about our interpretation of events than the events themselves), but in terms of raising important questions on the nature of faith, it succeeds beyond measure.", "the messenger: the story of joan of arc (1999) ***starring: milla jovovich, john malkovich, faye dunaway, dustin hoffman, and pascal greggory directed & co-writer: luc besson running time: 141 minutes rated r (for graphic violence, rape, and for language)by blake french: some classic stories just can't be updated. example: \"william shakespeare's romeo and juliet\" re-released in 1996. however, one of the greatest tragedies ever told, the story of joan of arc, has just been proven possible to be relateable even with time as its enemy. luc besson has created a fresh-feeling new version of joan called \"the messenger,\" a historical epic that, for better or worse, concentrates mostly on visual style and realistic war scenes rather than answering questions we don't already know about the characters in focus here. the historical joan of arc was a poor young french woman, who believed that there were spiritual signs that ordered her to be a messenger to aid the king of france to victory on the battle field. according to \"the messenger: the story of joan of arc,\" charles vii, married to the bitter yolande d'aragon, was very grateful of her assistance at the time, especially when joan explained that god has sent her to lead french troops to war with the english and be victorious. the visions seen (or imagined) by joan are clearly brought to life here, with more effective qualities than ever before in a joan of arc picture. they are filmed with many unusual special effects, bizarre camera tricks, and a beautifully crafted atmosphere of imagery. in use with these elements to the credit of the depicted scenes, they do a good job of expressing the spiritual dream-like moments through joan with an imaginative feeling of majesty and revealing emotion. the style, camera, and direction all contribute to making these sequences of the best material in the production. the film was shot in the czech republic, as well as the country of france. cinematographer thierry arbogast captures the courageous historical time period flawlessly in these locations. the battle scenes may get little off track at times; some sequences are meant more for brutality purposes rather than a strong, focused narrative story. the actors interpret their characters with a precise energetic edge. milla jovovich has the ability to be a believable joan of arc, but does push the limit on convincing us. some of the film's efforts are straining toward the idea that joan was somewhat mentally retarded-and jovovich does a great job presenting that. other familiar faces found in \"the messenger: the story of joan of arc\" include john malkovich as king charles vii, and faye dunaway as his spouse, yolande d'aragon. also the legendary dustin hoffman inhabits a brief but appropriate role as the grand inquisitor, and pascal greggory is the duke of alençon. there are scenes in this movie that make the audience stare at the screen in awe, but also scenes that make us ask ourselves questions. although much of the production is spent on developing joan's character and motives, the film still doesn't manage to answer some questions being asked by viewers pondering minds. we never learn if the visions joan experienced were a calling from god, or just a figment of her intellectual imagination. was joan really crazy, or only near eccentric? were the physical objects that joan felt were signs from a higher spirit actually what she thought they were? an ulterior source could have been lucifer deceiving the trusting joan. or did the french actually triumph in battles because of the spiritual strength accorded by joan, or was luck the element present? and i personally would have like a little more explanation of the grand inquisitor character. \"the messenger: the story of joan of arc\" is a serious dramatic tragedy, and it takes itself as that all of the time. luc besson has constructed a movie that is ambitious and inspiring, with no room for the compromising or modest. i recommend the picture weather you're a new comer or a veteran to the joan of arc mythology. even if you already know the story of joan of arc like the back of your hand, this telling might just surprise you.brought to you by columbia pictures.", "i know next to nothing about the joan of arc story, but i've liked luc besson's work, and the trailer was terrific, so i was looking forward to this movie, even after the bad reviews. as might be expected from a besson film, it looked incredible. the battle scenes were all well-handled, and as the warrior joan, jovovich was quite convincing. the rest of the movie was something else again.it seems to me besson and his co-writer, andrew birkin, were trying to do what kenneth branagh did in his version of hamlet; look at the lead character not as an icon, but as a normal human being, and try to explain their actions and behavior in that context. admittedly, since i am unfamiliar with this story, i am more receptive to this approach than those who hold joan as an icon, but i would have been more than willing to watch a movie which handled this material well. unfortunately, once besson established which way he wanted to go, he seemed unsure of how to get there. most of the drama is handled on a third-grade level(especially her trial), and we never really get into what made joan tick. though the scenes with dustin hoffman were involving, especially since he was so good, they too fell short in explaining joan. and jovovich can't quite access those depths yet.the rest of the cast is okay. malkovich and faye dunaway are playing types, but they play them well enough. tchecky kayro(i know i'm not spelling that right) and vincent cassel lend a sense of gravity to their roles as soldiers. but all in all, this is a movie whose reach was beyond its grasp.", "luc besson usually makes spectacular movies; leon, the fifth element, etc. joan of arc is no exception. it details the life of jeanne, the maiden of lorraine, who in and around the year 1431, helped france defeat england, and win a war that has lasted for almost an entire century. the plot is great, and it has a very good pace. i am almost never bored when watching this film, despite the fact that it's fairly long(about two and a half hours long), and i've seen it at least half a dozen times. what i've found to be great about the film is the re-watchable quality it has; i've seen it many times, yet i haven't grown tired of it. up to the very end, it always has a scene or two that you can look forward to, either because it's exceptionally well done, has very good cinematography, has great acting and/or dialog, or every one of those qualities. the acting is great. every single actor gives a great performance, even the child actors were convincing. the performances that impressed me the most, however, were those of milla jovovich and dustin hoffman, as jeanne and her conscience, respectively. they never cease to amaze me. the characters were well-written and credible. i particularly liked the way jeanne was written as having a very notable temper and being very decisive. i also very much enjoyed the various supporting characters, the best being la hire and the conscience. i liked the way the film seems to question jeanne's sanity; whereas most believe that she *was* in fact, sent by god, this film sits down and asks the question, if she really was, or if the signs and miracles weren't all in her head, and caused by everyone wanting to believe it. the very last scenes especially puts doubt in the viewer. it was quite a gutsy move by besson, to question his own country's hero. i will admit, the film does really make it seem more like she is crazy rather than sent by god, but it doesn't feel like besson is pushing his view onto us, telling us that that's the way it was; it feels more like he tries to make us question it. the action and the war scenes were very well done, very chaotic and disturbing, very intense and bloody. this isn't the best war movie ever made, nor is it the most factually accurate; it might not even be the best retelling of the legend of jeanne d'arc. but i have found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, well-choreographed, well-done film that makes you think. and that's good enough for me. several scenes are quite memorable, as are some of the lines. all in all, a very enjoyable war-drama, with an authentic story and some well-done battle sequences. i recommend it to fans of the actors, of luc besson's other work and of war movies/dramas in general. just don't expect a full-out war movie; it's two hours and thirty minutes long, and i don't think more than forty-five minutes in total are spent fighting. 7/10", "...but it still made interesting viewing. more biographies of jeanne d'arc exist than of any other person, and any attempt to portray her rather incredible life as france's greatest heroine and martyr on film can expect to encounter a similarly large number of second-guessers. this is precisely what happened when this picture came out. reviewers went on at length about what the picture should have been about, and how joan should have been portrayed (and by whom), leaving readers to wonder what they thought of the picture that had been made. this tendency to review the picture they wish had been made is a classic failing in many critics and this picture seemed to bring it out especially often.the picture that luc besson made here deserves to be appreciated on its own merits. it is visually stunning, rousingly action-packed, and full of interesting period details. yes, casting his supermodel wife milla jovovich in the lead was a risky choice, as her looks were hardly those of a typical medieval peasant. yes, her performance did not resonate with the period the way one by a more classically trained actress might, although she was clearly never trying to be ingrid bergman. still, milla's hyperactive personality made her interesting and watchable as a historical person about whom so much has been written, who nonetheless existed so far back in the past that she lacks a strongly identifiable humanity. when somebody makes a better statue than a person, as joan does from a contemporary viewpoint, odd casting choices can be forgiven if they work. milla's twisty mannerisms, rolling eyes and whispery speech give the viewer constant occasions to ponder just how much of joan's fanaticism came from genuine devotion to god and the church and how much was just an under-medicated personality disorder. this is actually one of the key scholarly issues surrounding joan's life, and the picture brings it to the fore in its latter part as joan herself tries to come to terms with her own claims of divine communication by means of a debate with dustin hoffman as her confessor-priest/conscience. that besson takes no particular viewpoint here is an interesting choice, and one which actually helps the viewer to understand why joan's story has compelled so many generations of historians.the political aspects of joan's life and legend were also dealt with in a nicely balanced fashion. like many figures in times when political and national alliances changed with the seasons, joan herself blew back and forth between being tremendously useful to the french throne at times and dangerously inconvenient at others. fame is a powerful commodity at any time, and the picture carefully tracked the rise and fall of joan's fortunes as she watched hers be manipulated, leveraged and ultimately put on trial.i thought a lot of the messenger and recommend it. religious and historical scholars are advised to approach with caution.", "what was interesting about this film was that it had a lot of focus on the non-historical parts of the story. meaning there was a lot of attention paid to joan of arc's psyche and the visions she had, so this isn't a documentary. i think they did it very well.one thing that made me uneasy after a while was their continued use of some lens (i'm not a camera person) for every shot of joan, where in most movies it's only used for a few dramatic shots.and every part with dustin hoffman's character was great. not just because of his acting, but also the scene cuts to the visions, the visions themselves (3 months after death...), and the way he moved about her mind.", "besson's version of the story of joan of arc offended me on many levels. the opening sequences of the movie feature the gruesome murder and rape (in that order) of joan's sister. this was completely unnecessary and untrue. while it is fact that joan's town was raided several times and on one occasion burned by the english; joan of arc had 2 brothers, but no sisters. this alone was enough to ruin the movie for me, since besson proceeds to build a case that all of joan's actions and her descent into insanity were caused by the horrific death of her sister.besson also inexplicably created a sinister tormentor for joan, played by dustine hoffman. hoffman's character who continually played the devil's advocate to a clearly insane joan, was just plain annoying, confusing, and yet another fabrication. besson's joan was never seen having the visions of st. margaret, st. catherine, and st. michael which the real joan of arc was reported to have. instead she saw a twisted and almost demonic christ figure and the strange dustin hoffman character. for besson to portray a saint and a french national hero in such a manner was purely offensive and in poor taste. had besson actually bothered to base his story on historical fact i may have felt differently. if you see this movie, regard it only as a work of fiction, for it bears little in common with the real joan of arc other than her name and that she freed orleans.", "i found luc besson's take on the story of joan of arc thoroughly compelling. like all of besson's films, the messenger is highly stylized, nicely cast, and visually powerful. the film is also forgivably anachronistic in terms of language while developing a strong period feel through sets and costume. joan was, of course, the deeply religious teenage girl who lead prince charles' army to improbable victory over the invading english at orleans and helped re-consolidate french sovereignty. joan considered herself god's appointed messenger, and france apparently saw her as an avenging angel. today, she is commonly regarded as a schizophrenic. she was canonized in the 1950s, 500 years after her death. regardless of whether god or insanity was the source of her strength, power, will and incredible courage - there is little ambiguity about her role in the salvation of france nor the fate that awaited her afterward. in general, the acting is quite good. jovovich's much-maligned performance is actually very good and exactly appropriate for what besson was trying to do with the film. comparing joan of arc to her other messianic role as leelu in the fifth element is, frankly, ridiculous. i believe that the problems people find in jovovich's performance are problems those same people bring to the film. malkovich and dunaway are phenomenal. tcheky karyo and vincent cassell provide excellent support. besson strays from what we think we know about the details of joan's story, but only to present the truth of the big-picture more accurately. his film steadfastly refuses to answer the questions many people will bring to it: * was joan schizophrenic? * was she a catholic messiah or divinely inspired prophet?why is besson so careful about accurately presenting the ambiguity of the story? i think he wanted to make a moving film, but not a film which would unsubtly challenge its audience's beliefs. if you do not believe, you will tend to explain dustin hoffman's character as a manifestation of joan's psychological problems. if you do believe, you may want to think of him as satan, am angel, perhaps both. thus, besson, who is a deeply spiritual person, makes a powerful statement about faith through his metanarrative while maintaining an appropriately unevangelical position. he took similar paths in his more uplifting films the fifth element and angel-a.highly recommended for besson and jovovich fans. not a biography - avoid this if you must have the \"plain\" facts! mildly recommended as a piece of historical fiction.", "the cinematographic industry, which, since its inception, has produced many films with historical themes in general and medieval ones in particular, has been occupied for a long time with the figure of joan of arc. no other medieval historical character has been represented so many times on screen. besson's film presents a version of joan that differs from all others. the originality here derives not so much from its poetic licenses - present, obviously, in all other versions of cinema and literature - as in the way joana is interpreted and her motivations. besson and his other screenwriter, andrew berkin, begin their script in the french heroine's childhood, when her life is turned upside down by an english attack that not only destroys her city, but also causes the death of her family. with this seed planted, the text opens the way for constant inquiries by the spectator and the other characters, putting in check the supposed visions and messages from god that the girl receives. wouldn't they just be reflections of her childhood trauma? the question extends to the girl's own motivations in leading the troops against the british - would this not be just a strong feeling of revenge, solidified over the years?among the many joans of arc that cinema has produced, there is a wide variety of styles and approaches. some films tried to reproduce the story chronologically, others centered the narrative on a specific moment in joan's life, such as the films the passion of joan of arc, by carl dreyer and le procès de jeanne d'arc, by robert bresson, which were focus on the process and execution of the heroine. among the chronologically oriented films for the reproduction of joana's life, two versions from 1999 are almost antagonistic. in addition to luc besson's version, this year's lesser-known - probably because less controversial - version by christian duguay, with actress leelee sobieski, is also from this year. the young actress portrays joana as pious, humane and close to the traditional model. she is upbeat and confident most of the time, supported by her voices.and bravely faces the judges and death at the stake. in this film - unlike luc besson's - we have voices, lights and miracles. although there is some political reflection that appears in moments such as when the dauphin and his advisors argue about the advantage of using or not the \"tactic of the virgin of lorraine\", in general, this version could almost be taken as an official version of the story. of joan of arc, in a similar line to that adopted by the film, much better known despite its earlier date, by victor fleming.luc besson's joan, played by milla jovovich, has a much more difficult task: instead of following a sympathetic historical model, the actress must search for her motivations and, finally, invert her meaning. luc besson's joan does not have the support of the voices that confirm sobieski's mission, on the contrary, since childhood we see luc besson's joan accompanied by an enigmatic character who is a boy when she is a child and who grows up together with the heroine, although it ages faster than her. it is this character - played by actor dustin hoffmann - who is highlighted in the final part of the film as the voice that questions joana, her actions and motivations. and he who says, for example, that a sword found in the field is not necessarily a sign of his mission, as interpreted by joana, but that there are several other possible explanations for her presence in that location: joana chooses what she wants to see. in this final \"dialogue\" between the two actors - which i think can be interpreted as one of the central axes of the film - we can perceive the conflict between two eras, two ways of thinking. for the historical heroine and her medieval contemporaries, imbued with a strong religious feeling, the search for signs, the interpretation of everyday life through symbols, was very common. but in luc besson's film, unlike duguay's, there are no miracles.however, the historical joan of arc - as the documents of her process demonstrate - was strongly imbued with what bonnassie calls historical providentialism, that is: the belief that the divine will manifests itself on earth through - and for - the action human. joan of arc strongly believed this, to the point of dying for this belief. but, for luc besson, what joana's character understood as a mission from god was, in reality, something self-attributed: she ends up recognizing that she fought for revenge and the way people fight even when fighting for a cause: being cruel, selfish, and proud.the film does not call into question the cause itself, but the means of carrying it out, and in doing so contains a condemnation of war that is very current: even those who believe they are fighting for a just cause - god, the land, the freedom - are in reality cruel and proud. in one of the battles scenes, it is shown how joana fights in a frenzy and then goes into shock when she sees the mutilated bodies, severed limbs and bloodshed: the fact that this is only perceived after the battle - when there is no possible return - is part of the director's central message: war develops a logic of its own, engulfs its agents, the means drown the noblest ends that are pursued. can defend. the director, who had already hinted at his skeptical stance - as in the words of the dauphin's mother-in-law, at various times in the film, especially at the coronation ceremony - makes the clash of positions in this dialogue more explicit. with his rationalist vision of the 20th century, dustin hoffman's character - and through him the director seems to speak - questions joana's own performance and motives: instead of donation and idealism we have rancor, desire for revenge and power.giving even more substance to such doubts, the work of director brings us a truly shaken figure in joana's place. milla jovovich, as the protagonist, embodies the image of madness with surgical precision - an explosive girl, practically bipolar and with marked traits of schizophrenia. again, it is important to reiterate that it is not possible to say with certainty whether the young woman's mind generates the visions or if they provoke such outbreaks, which border on psychosis. this uncertainty is where the great beauty of the work lies and besson knows it, inserting these emblematic situations in key points of the plot, assuming a greater presence as we go through the campaigns led by the heroine - which, as shown several times, also exert a notable influence. pressure on the psyche of the protagonist. the film, however, uses more than just its text and direction to illustrate the fragility of joana's mind. edited by sylvie landra, the narrative presents numerous ellipses that very well illustrate the dreamlike character of joana's life, as constant memory loss transports her from one place to another completely different one. making good use of this resource, the feature film gains an evident fluidity, not extending into overly long and unnecessary sequences.another obvious problem with the feature is the way it portrays some characters, especially king charles vii (john malkovich) of france, with overly caricatured personalities that diminish the impact of any twists and turns throughout the narrative. in other words, at certain points we identify the old predictability making a presence and acting to reduce the tension of the audiences. besson, however, regains his dominance with the already mentioned fluidity of the plot, knowing how to use historical facts in his favor. as much as we know joana's final destination, it is practically impossible not to root for a different result and until the final seconds, we are left with a constant doubt as to whether history will materialize or not. supporting this remarkable anguish close to the end, dustin hoffman's character brings up all the questioning of the character's beliefs, placing in the foreground the clash between madness and faith that so well accompany the pace of the projection - whether in the most intimate moments, whether on the bloody battlefields.thierry arbogast's photography once again, as we have seen in the director's other works, proves to be essential, managing to capture all the character's anguish even in the midst of hundreds of soldiers. at this point i must highlight an emblematic sequence that places the heroine practically being carried away in the middle of an attack on the gate of a fortress - thierry manages to show us perfectly how lost the character is in that environment, using it to represent our shock in the face of all that violence medieval. violence, this one, which guarantees a reality, rawness, in the face of the protagonist's dreamlike situation.besson deals with the theme when mixing two categories of films: films of historical characters, especially biographical ones, and the films that this author defines as \"by historians\", in which the fiction implicitly aims to illustrate a point of view about the past, in this case an opinion about the war. in this sense, besson scratches the taboo created not only around the figure of joan of arc, but around the illusions that medieval and contemporary men weave for themselves to make it possible to live with terrible phenomena such as war, whatever its form. justification.at the end of the projection, it is made clear to us that, more than a historical portrayal, this is an intimate view of the mind of this warrior. witch or saint? messenger of god or crazy? these are questions that stick with us even as the credits roll. even so, regardless of the answer we decide to accept, we cannot help but feel a distinct admiration for joana, who maintained her determination until the end. luc besson once again brings us a strong character and an unforgettable portrait of this historical figure.", "the only reason i'm spending the time to post a comment here is to warn you not to waste two and half hours of your life on this film, like i did.even though i had heard mixed reviews, i went into the theatre with a very positive attitude about this film, since i've enjoyed besson's past films, as well as the work of many of this cast.looking back, i should have followed my gut instinct and left about a minute and a half into the film: pretty much any time a filmmaker uses a gothic typeface in titles and expository text and then adds something ridiculous like blood running over a map, you can bet your life that the rest of the film will show the same stupidity, lack of taste, and disrespect for the intelligence of the viewer. the murder/rape (in that order) a few minutes later confirmed my first impression, but for some reason i stayed.maybe i stayed because i teach classes on film and watch a lot of movies, and i am more than willing to give any film a fair shot (and sometimes two or three). i wanted this film to succeed. but it falls down on so many levels that i felt my own calling from god, as it were, to wage a small battle against it.the reviews published by the san francisco papers, ny times and chicago sun-times (ebert) give a pretty good summary of what's wrong with this film, even though i think their \"two stars\" ratings are quite generous.to summarize my own thoughts on the film, i feel that the script doesn't know what story it's trying to tell, and besson and jovovich seem to have no sense at all for the complexities of joan's story, as it has come down to us.the acting is as overwrought and void of subtlety as any i've seen in a long time. the only highlights are a couple of performances from supporting characters (who unfortunately are shackled by the poor screenplay) and dustin hoffman's appearance toward the end of the film (way too little, way too late to save the film). i felt particularly saddened by the clownish performance john malkovich gives, although i can't help but think/hope that he was forced to do it by besson. (i wondered while watching the scene where joan tells charles about her revelations whether malkovich was mocking jovovich . . . and the whole production for that matter.)everything else you see in the film (art direction, costume design, soundtrack, special effects, even the look of every single supporting and bit player, etc. etc.) is as cliche and unimaginative as the screenplay and acting. it feels as if besson and co. sat down and said, \"what is the absolutely most stereotypical image that the average moviegoer who knows nothing about 15th-century france or joan of arc or who has never thought about spiritual things in a meaningful way will expect when he or she sits down to watch this film?\" and then, having done little thinking themselves, they filmed it.", "if it were not based on a true story, luc besson's `the messenger: the story of joan of arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile wide. since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those mind-boggling historical incredibilities.joan was, of course, the deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed were visions and voices sent directly by god - assuring her and france of a glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading english army - managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat. we first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety, attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and, eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the british by the rape and murder of her beloved older sister. we see the french royalty, so driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the brutal british onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories. but glory is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it is gained  and joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of restoring the french monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the english, tried by the catholic church, and burned at the stake by the english government for the crime of witchcraft.given this fascinating and astonishing series of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in interest and insight. and, indeed, `the messenger' is, perhaps, a better film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would indicate. the first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of the tale. the warrior joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all these military strategists would follow. but, about midway through the film, the screenwriters, andrew birkin and writer/director besson, begin to apply some psychological depth to the character. after a particularly sanguine encounter with the english, in which hundreds of decapitated and limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, joan breaks down in despair over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight. from then on, her actions arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic teachings of christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country. when she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an obsession for personal glory and power. we're a long way from the astute psychological insights of carl dreyer's classic silent film version of the story, `the passion of jeanne d'arc,' but `the messenger' does take occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the question of whether joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion borne of insanity. unfortunately, casting dustin hoffman as the voice of conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. every time his overly familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud  hardly the tone one wants to establish as joan of arc marches grimly to the stake. also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the film's era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.in terms of dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable hobson's choice: should the writers employ language that reflects the reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated by today's standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? the writers of `the messenger' have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she's nuts!' and `i'm gonna kill that f------ bitch' along with a barrage of four-letter word expletives with which no contemporary pg-13 or r-rated feature could ever do without.those with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence had best be forewarned: the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited, register high on the bloodletting scale.of the performers, none matches in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that adorn the film. milla jovovich is, at best, adequate as joan, rarely giving more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles occurring at the root of her personality. john malkovich, as the would-be french king, for whose throne joan lays her life on the line, has his moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film to allow him to create a multifaceted performance. faye dunaway brings a cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative mother-in-law.`the messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.", "it's 15th century france. joan of arc (milla jovovich) is the teenage warrior leading the fight against the english.this is luc besson's grand take on the heroine joan of arc with lots of gusto. milla jovovich certainly has the crazed intensity of a zealot. sometimes, it drifts towards camp. considering she got the job because she was married to luc besson at the time, it could have gone a lot worst.the basic storyline is well known. the best parts of the story happens midway in the movie. that's where the big battle scenes occur. certainly the battles are big especially for using real action in modern movies. after the battles, the story drags as she gets captured and tried. it may be better to climax the film with the big win in orléans. keep the slower parts as a postscript.", "the story of joan of arc is a very interesting story and this movie doesn't do much justice to this story. it does create a creepy atmosphere with a nice visual style and therefore the movie was good enough for me. i was hoping for a little more of joan of arc and her life but i guess you can't have it all.we begin with joan when she is still young, played by jane valentine in a very good way. we see how her sister is killed and raped, in that order, and how she finds a sword. she thinks this is one of the signs from god; we get to see some more. whether they really are signs the movie kind of leaves in the middle with the appearance of something like her conscience (dustin hoffman). we see how she gets her own army, has success, but is captured after charles vii (john malkovich) is crowned as the king of france and doesn't really support her anymore. as most people know joan of arc was burned alive when she was only 19 years old.milla jovovich plays the older joan. director luc besson also used her for his 'the fifth element' and although she is not really bad here she was better in her element in that first movie. luc besson was actually the reason i went to see this movie, after his great 'léon' and the goofy 'the fifth element'. he didn't disappoint me with his direction, but he did with the movie. after a pretty good start the movie gets a little boring and it seems that the most simple way is chosen to tell the story. even the visual style is much better in the first half of the movie.", "what a terrific performance from the lead female, bursting with faith and power; worth a look for that alone. and magnificent battle scenes and costumes is another highlight of this movie. the story is about the real life joan of arc who whilst still a teen and hearing voices from god went about saving medieval france from the clutches of the invading english,but then again politic are politics....however:on the negative side many of the actors are very english and are meant to be french so that causes a bit of a problem as the whole film is in english;plus give certain actors costumes and frills and they \"camp\" it up no end, and at times this picture is almost pantomine stuff.and the worst of it is that dustin hoffmann plays some spook meant to be the conscience or devil in joan and he nearly ruins the film with his conceited \"hey-look-at-me-what a star-i am\". well dustin i got a message for you and it don't come from above: you very nearly destroy this film and you ought to stick to the likes of being mrs robinsons' toy boy as you are out of your depth in this one despite you believing otherwise.hence i have taken two votes off for the appalling dustin and my vote is:6/10", "clearly a besson movie (compare it to le grand bleu and léon).the camerawork is beautiful and adds very well to the drama. dialogs are well balanced and strong. a great peace of cinema that grabs you and you don't realize it takes 2.5 hours. the only drawback i could find is that the french actually should have spoken french.i regret i haven't seen it at home and not in a cinema theater, which would have been even better. not a masterpiece, but pretty close to it...", "from what i had heard prior to renting this movie, i figured that i would be in for a decent, though liberally violent interpretation of jeanne d'arc with historical accuracy that would outweigh most, if not all, of its negative aspects. but what can i say, other than that people don't recognize garbage no matter how far down their throats it is shoved?for this movie to receive any praise at all is ludicrous in itself. certainly, it could be an interesting prospect to examine the life of a supposedly-schizophrenic national figure with more negative connotations than positive, but how far is it necessary to go to portray besson's notion that jeanne d'arc may not have been as holy as she has been said to be? how necessary is it to continually emphasize total pharisaism as opposed to mere pride? how necessary is it to portray jeanne's visions as downright satanic, and dispense of the saints which had supposedly spoken to her? and how necessary is it to portray her as a raving psychopath?if one is going to argue for historical accuracy, then perhaps they should keep something in mind: simply because somebody engages in a battle which in actuality took place, it does not make for accuracy; the same goes for an individual performing a certain action, or any other occurring event. in fact, this movie appears to guise itself under \"historical accuracy,\" while it fails to explain any of the events that are taking place at the time. yes, we know that france is divided and that the english are attempting to take over, but are we ever introduced to any of the political intricacies or other matters that jeanne partook in other than those on the battle field? anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that jeanne d'arc's story is not one of war.in addition, there is lewd and tasteless humor interspersed throughout the entirety of this movie. obviously, it was not enough to view the life of jeanne d'arc through the eyes of a cynic, but through the eyes of a perverse, teenage-minded director as well. if you're looking for a modern film on joan of arc, do yourself a favor and take a look at the tv movie starring leelee sobieski. despite the fact that it is not historically accurate, it is far more intellectual and entertaining than \"the messenger\" will ever be.", "if milla jovovich does not receive an academy award as well as the film garnering the palm d'or at cannes, then i will be absolutely shocked. this is a movie with such terrible impact that half the audience was in tears. i can not speak to the authenticity of the history but anyone will see that the theme and message were crystal clear. a must see. without reservation, i can give this film a rating of 10 and i thought that i'd never do anything so extreme, but this film deserves a 10.", "this joan of arc (1999) by luc besson boasts a good cast with milla jovovich , tchéky karyo as dunois , john malkovich as charles vii , vincent cassell as gilles de rais , faye dunaway , dustin hoffman , pascal greggory and toby jones . the movie is set in ¨hundred years' war¨ developed from1337 to 1453 (downfall date of constantinople invaded by turks). the historical deeds are the following ones : henry v vanquishes charles vi in agincourt (1415) that was a major english victory against a numerically superior french army in the hundred years' war . the battle occurred on friday , 25 october 1415 and henry v takes over normandy . charles vi of france signs ¨troyes treatise¨ in which henry v is wedded charles's daughter . in 1412, a young girl called jeanne is born in domrémy, france. jeanne develops into a very religious young woman, she confesses several times a day. at the age of 13, she has her first vision and finds a sword. years after that, in 1428, she knows her mission is to be ridding france of the english and so sets out to meet charles, the dauphin. later on , henry vi of england proclaims himself king of france but then joan of arc , a peasant girl hears saints' voices telling her to help dauphin charles claim the french throne and drive out the english . being nineteen years old , proclaims in bourges to charles vii as king , after being crowned in reims . charles persuades joan to proclaim herself the legendary maid of lorraine and raise an army to battle the brits . joan of arc acting as a divine mission defeats the english army in orleans . but she's captured by the borgoneses and put on trial for sorcery and heresy ; being subsequently sold and handed over the english authorities and they fire her for heretic and witch in rouen. a legend !. a saint !. she died at 19. 500 years later her legend lives on!earnest and overlong runtime biopic , approx three hours , but is neither boring , nor dull , but entertaining . the film leans heavily on gory battles and the spectacular scenarios are very well designed , there are thousands of extras and the struggles are breathtaking . the ending trial in which she's condemned is very interesting and the sentence at the burning pole is overwhelming and exciting . milla jovovich , who was 23 when shooting , gives a stilted dialogue , providing pop-eyed , excessive and semi-intelligible interpretation , overacting at times , along with john malkovich as charles vii , the king who betrayed her . furthermore , timothy west as the cunning bishop is excellent as well as the mysterious role finely played by dustin hoffman as her conscience with whom joan has thought-provoking conversations , bringing-up questions in her mind whether she was actually divinely inspired or merely a set-up . the support cast is satisfying , such as : desmond harrington , vincent regan , pascal greggory , jacques herlin , tchéky karyo , gina mckee , richard ridings, among others . the motion picture was well directed by successful producer/writer/filmmaker luc besson . the yarn will appeal to historic event buffs . rating : 6.5/10 . worth viewing this breathtaking historical picture .other films about this historic character are the following ones : ;

carl theodor dreyer with maria falconetti and joan the woman (1916) by cecil b demille.", "the movie is truly atrocious. instead of being portrayed as the powerful and inspirational figure that she was, joan d'arc comes across as an insipid dumb blonde, and a looney. for most of the movie she alternates between seeming like a frightened rabbit (as somebody else commented) and a plain air-head. not really the type of character you would expect to inspire the might of france, and strike fear into the english.the messenger gets off to a very poor start. despite being based on real historic events it seemed completely contrived and unbelievable to the point of being stupid. a lot of this comes down to the choice of actresses to play joan. despite not seeing 5th element, i'm told her non-talking part was fine. but in choosing his wife to play a role that required serious acting luc besson has doomed this movie to a very quick demise. beyond the acting, much of the problem may have been the script and direction. even john malchovic, in my opinion one of the best actors in the world, ********* many people seeing this movie may be more interested in the battle scenes than the acting or historical accuracy. about a third of the way through they won't be disappointed. the war scene in the middle is admittedly good. unfortunately for the next 2 hours even the action buffs will have to put up with the intense boredom of the remainder of the film. all of the people i was with, half of who enjoyed the first part of the movie, were squirming in their seats by the end hoping for joan to get burned so they could get out of the cinema.that all said, 157 people in imdb still did rate the movie a 10. so unless they are all friends in the industry somebody may have liked this movie.", "i loved this movie. it's visually stunning and the casting and acting was superb. the story was already layed out (approximately), so luc besson concentrated on jeanne herself, the person and what she was like and why she did what she did.i have to admit to putting myself in jeanne's place, feeling what she must have been feeling along the way. i think without that, it probably would have been a much duller movie, although probably entertaining.the battles scenes, of which there were many, were graphic and brutal. dismemberments, swords and maces swinging, lots of pain and death. the ensuing desolation at the end of a battle were weighty and gave a a horrible look at the conditions of the time.my final impressions... joan of arc, if the portrayals were accurate was a driven young woman, deeply religious and deeply confused who was probably at least partially insane. if she were alive today, no doubt, she would be treated with common drugs and would lead a normal life. i felt very sorry for her and her situation and for the way that she was treated. i know people would argue that there is no need to feel this way, because she was clear and sure of her purpose. i don't feel that this was ever the case and she was sure only that she was going crazy if she didn't do something.movies don't usually move me this way and i'm really amazed.", "from director luc besson (the transporter, the fifth element), who also co-writes, comes the 1999 historical drama film the messenger: the story of joan of arc, a film which by and large follows in the tradition of other stalwarts in the genre (such as braveheart.) as the title may suggest, this movie is all about jeanne d'arc, the peasant girl who would later claim to have seen visions from god and lead the armies of france to several triumphs over the english during the hundred years war.the film is impressive. even if it is not perfectly accurate in a historical sense, it does outline the highlights of joan's campaign, the prominent figures who fought with and against her, and works wonders in capturing the sheer brutality of battle.milla jovovich (resident evil, the fifth element) is wonderful as the violent, aggressive, and zealous titular character, with her hatred for the english and desire to do god's will made plain on every shot of her face in battle.strong supporting turns from john malkovich (burn after reading, being john malkovich), dustin hoffman (sleepers, rain man), tchéky karyo (the patriot, goldeneye), and vincent cassel (eastern promises, ocean's twelve) round out the film's acting retinue.the battle sequences are brilliantly and brutally shot, specifically designed to do away with the glorification of war that is so frequently seen in movies such as this; men are decapitated, blood sprays, heads are smashed to a pulp. the savagery of 15th-century warfare is brought to the fore effectively and honestly.but the post-capture sequences are equally entertaining, and this is largely because of dustin hoffman's spectacular turn as 'the conscience'. in many ways, hoffman carries the second act of the messenger, and his rendering should have been oscar-worthy.about the only place the film really suffers is in small areas of scripting. there are times when characters say silly, or outright stupid, lines. this is especially true in the moments leading in to battle.all in all, the movie was entertaining, and worth buying for anyone who wants to expand their library.7/10.", "if jacques rivette's joan the maid movies are steeped in reality then luc besson's the messenger is the fever filled fantasy of joan of arc's delusion. a beautiful movie to look at with it's sweeping wide shots and it adoring camera gaze at milla jovovich. the problem lies squarely on the shoulders of jovovich however as she chooses to play joan as a disturbed hysteric rather than a visionary in control of her self belief real or not. she screams, yells, shakes and throws tantrums that make it hard to believe that any seasoned soldiers of the 15th century would have followed such an obviously disturbed woman into battle. this derails our belief in what is going on. jovovich is much better in the quieter moments especially in the last half hour. a visual feast and even an entertaining watch. wish milla would have toned down her performance though.", "for better or worse, this joan of arc film feels like luc besson watched braveheart and said \"i want to do zat huh-huh-huh.\" it's got the bombast, swings, misses, and quirks you'd expect.i'd call the movie fun because of how explosive it gets, besides that one particularly horrifying part near the start. you don't really see acts like that shown in movies anymore, or nearly as often, and never with that level of horror. even though the intent is clearly to be horrible, i understand the argument that such scenes go too far.milla jovovich really goes for it with her lead performance throughout. she screams a lot and there is some unhinged camerawork. when she screams and the visuals are unhinged, it can get a bit unintentionally funny. i respect how much jovovich committed (that stunt where it looked like she fell a pretty long way was impressive), but i don't know if playing joan of arc like she's possessed always works. it doesn't really double down on the psychological drama side of things, if that's the approach it wanted to take. besson gets too caught up staging his braveheart battles, and it leaves the more introspective side of the story feeling lacking.but even with the length, this was strangely watchable, for the most part. some brazen choices and instances of camerawork fit, and others are baffling, but i was definitely engaged more than i expected to be. it's a highly flawed film, and occasionally frustrating, but i don't regret watching it. it's been easy to write a review for, and that's usually a sign that a film has something to offer, or at least is distinct and potentially memorable (again, for reasons both good and perhaps not so good).", "there a a few strengths to this film that are overshadowed by many weaknesses. for one, mila jovovich gives an excellent performance. she portrays a manic, self possessed and self righteous woman acting out the will of a higher power she nonetheless makes joan an interesting character to watch and empathize with. luc besson delivers with his excellent cinematics and camera work. between his direction and mila's performance this is a truly beautiful film.however, the dialogue for nearly everyone except for mila and dustin hoffman is very flat. at times the dialogue is full of modern anachronisms that are very distracting and cheapen the whole ambiance of the film. it seemed as if the film was trying to be hip while portraying an important historic drama. there are too many examples of this to quote here, but suffice it to say that poor dialogue ruined an otherwise good film.see the messenger for mila, see it for good direction in film, but be prepared to groan when the talking starts.6 out of 10.", "i absolutely love this movie. i remember the reviews being harsh at the time of release which was expected considering the subject matter. personally i always get something out of luc besson films as they are so beautiful to look at with sweeping camera shots that give an epic feel and this is no different. the humour contrasts very well with some shocking scenes that balance the film very well. credit must also be given to the costume and set crew as the attention to detail is fantastic. this is a film to get lost in (like any good film in my view) and enjoy. forget about the historical events and enjoy filmmaking at its best.8/10", "i think that the messenger had beautiful scenery, powerful imagery, and very interesting secondary character. also, the inquisition part of the movie was very good. but i think that joan's character was rather weak. she never seemed really sure of herself, and did not irradiate charisma. her character was very much like that of leeloo in the 5th element. and i think that a medieval woman, and a peasant as well, being received in the king's court and given an army, leading two hundred thousand soldiers in war must have had something special. the depiction of joan as it is in the movie is unrealistic. she would have needed an aura, and a very strong will.but still i think that its very good movie and worth seeing.", "this movie ranks as one of the most disappointing films of all time.jovovich's acting was terrible. i grew to dislike her more every minute. the character she portrays is more psychotic than heroic. she comes across as someone who would suffer a nervous breakdown over a trip to the grocery store, not someone who could inspire an army.the script was laughable. i don't understand why they didn't try to use more period language. i cringed at some of the lines (\"everything will be fine.\") why stars like dunaway and hoffman would appear in this film is beyond me.", "a briskly-paced bio of joan of arc, including numerous graphic battle scenes. characters portrayed \"with the bark on\" - soldiers of both english and french forces covered in mud, with horribly rotten teeth and decorated with scars - probably what people really looked like, in the early 1400s. other scenes adding realism include watching people eat food (something you don't normally see, in movies). whatever they ate, it came from a boiling pot - broth, some chunks of veggies and whatever meat might be had...again, the unusual portrayal of common people eating was deliberate, and added \"texture\" to the surroundings.joan herself in the movie is all that she was portrayed to be in real life: a historical fluke - a 17-year old girl, led by her \"visions\", who becomes the leader of an army, and the \"difficult\", she accomplishes quickly....the \"nearly impossible\", takes her a bit longer.i was a bit confused about the role of dustin hoffman. at first, i was sure he was an angel, sent to counsel joan as a sort of \"doubting thomas\" - leading her to a true self-examination of her motives - lending objectivity to her track record, in an effort to get her to understand why fortunes ran against her. but, he is listed as her \"conscience\"...her own inner voice.i gave this movie a \"9\" rating. it will only be enjoyed by those who have an interest in history, or the life of joan, but in anticipation that most of the audience will fit this description, i would say that 9 out of 10 will like it. the rating above, of 6+, is probably a reflection of many viewers who were hoping for something else.....people who watch \"transformers\", or romantic comedies.", "luc besson (léon, the three burials of melquiades estrada, danny the dog, transporter 1, 2, and 3)) can always be depended upon to present a film worth watching. here he gives us a story of joan of arc that will probably not answer question from those who are interested in her.was she developmentally disable? most likely. was she mentally ill? is seems that she probably was. besson presents an argument for both, but that is not his primary focus.it is in the battles where he focuses his energy and craft. we see graphic images of war with severed heads and limbs, and medieval weapons that excite and entertain us.we also see the corruption of the catholic church during that period and their focus more on political power than doing god's work.milla jovovich (resident evil, the fifth element) was a perfect joan of arc, with just the right qualities.john malkovich was also good as charles vii.i always enjoy vincent cassel and tchéky karyo, and neither disappointed me.besson is one of my favorites and i can't wait for transporter 3.", "this piece of trash is totally without merit. there are many inaccuracies about the maid. i have extensive knowledge of her life, and this movie must be about someone else. on the dvd, milla jovovich has the gall to say that the producers uncovered so much information about the maid, that i am prompted to ask: \"then, why didn't your husband use it?\" (she was married to luc besson during filming.)joan's sister was neither raped nor murdered by any raiders.there is no history of joan breaking into a church and drinking wine.joan was close to her parents, and left them, sadly, when she went to vaucoleurs (sic).joan never killed anyone, nor tried to. \"the conscience\" is a creation of luc besson; no evidence that such a personality ever talked with joan.if you want to know more of the truth about joan, read the book by regine pernoud, or even the movie \"jeanne la pucelle\", starring sandrine bonnaire, is adequate.", "let me preface my comments for \"the messenger\" by stating that i am a catholic who grew up in the 50s, and my home parish was \"st joan of arc.\" not only that, but when my children were growing up, in a different place, our church was also \"st joan of arc\". so you might say i have a long standing interest in the subject.before i saw this one, i saw the other recent one, with leelee sobieski in the lead role. both are wonderful movies, and very different in their approach. i think milla jovovich's performance as joan in this one is truly great. she is, at various times, an innocent peasant trying to follow god's call, and a half-crazed warrior bent of exterminating the british who won't leave her land.luc besson directed \"the messenger\" in a more epic style, sometimes going overboard with battle scenes, and \"50 ways to kill your enemy.\" but he also used grand music, great special effects, and one of the best uses of front and rear channel surround sound on the dolby digital 5.1 dvd version. there also is a good dollop of low-frequency bass that tests your subwoofer, and rattles your picture frames. without a modern home-theater sound system, this would be a totally different and inferior movie experience.one of the \"extras\" on the dvd is a featurette, narrated primarily my milla jovovich, which delves into the \"making of\" this film. they did extensive research in france, used some of the translations of the original trial transcript, and used 15th century drawings of events in her life to model the costumes and sets. the result is a very realistic portrayal of the historical events in those two years, 1429 through 1431, when joan was 17 through 19, and lead the french army against the british to save france.the film makes clever use of a fictional character called \"the conscience\", played by dustin hoffman. he shows up when joan is in prison awaiting trial. no one else can see him, he is obviously a vision, that she talks to, and expresses her doubts. some have said this makes the film an \"atheistic\" view of joan. i strongly disagree. to me it brings out more clearly her humanity, her natural doubts about what she really heard from god, and what she may have done on her own. her asking for \"confession\" and forgiveness is a natural response for someone who was so strongly grounded in her catholic faith.all-in-all, for someone wanting both an entertaining and significant movie experience, \"the messenger\" delivers. it is a bit long, almost 3 hours, but it never gets slow or boring. in addition to jovovich and hoffman, john malkovich is good as the dauphin who becomes king of france, and faye dunnaway as his stepmother. i rate this movie a strong \"8\" of 10.", "simply put: a \"monstrously\" unjust film to the real st. joan!!! it is very difficult not to be inspired by her story, but luc besson makes that task quite easy. milla, while good in many scenes, definitely was no leelee...the winner by a knockout: joan of arc: cbs mini series.", "this is a rather irreverent and disturbing look at the life of saint joan of arc. the portrayal of her early life was very good, giving her a sincerity and piety that made the child joan an attractive character. however, once milla jovovich took over as the teen joan, she became a raving lunatic. clearly, this was no accident. she and director luc besson are husband and wife, and it is obvious that this is their combined interpretation of joan.the problem with this portrayal was that joan was made to be appear so demented that she lost credibility as a believable character. her belief in her voices was depicted more as mad fanaticism than unshakeable faith. personally, i have no problem with this interpretation, since i am more apt to believe her voices were the result of an unbalanced psyche than the voice of god. the problem i have is believing that anyone, even in the 15th century, would give an army to someone who is so obviously over the edge. moreover, it is a stretch to believe that even the most desperate of simple minded men would follow such a character into battle.if the portrayal were just a little more balanced, with moments of piety, sincerity and lucidity, the viewer and the other characters around her might be justified in saying, `is she divinely inspired or simply mad?' only when that question resonates has joan been portrayed effectively. in this interpretation there was never any question. she was clearly a madwoman. it was almost a relief when they finally did away with her.that being said, i must say that from a technical standpoint this was a brilliantly directed film. luc besson has produced a compelling visual work of art. the opening scenes of young joan running through the fields were exquisite. the battle carnage was authentically grisly and the action realistic. the costumes were wonderful and the locations and sets well chosen and well crafted. his camera perspectives gave great impact to every scene. his imagary of supernatural events was electrifying. in every regard, other than joan's character interpretation, this was an inspired work.milla jovovich gave a superb performance as joan the mad. though i don't agree with the interpretation, i can't imagine such insanity delivered any more effectively. she really seemed well suited for a jacket with wrap around sleeves. in every scene she exuded white hot intensity, especially in the battle scenes. her performance was truly tour de force.faye dunaway was fabulous as the cunning yolande d'aragon. she was so nefarious and in control, deliciously evil and conniving. john malkovich did an excellent job portraying charles vii, however he was a bit old for the part. charles was born in 1403 and met joan in 1429 at the tender age of 26. malkovich has trouble passing for 46 (his actual age) no less 26.dustin hoffman's minor role as the conscience was also quite well done. unfortunately, it lost some effectiveness because he was never really put in context. was he another of joan's creations or an actual being? a little defining dialogue would have helped develop his character better. this is a fine film with a fatal flaw. if the story is to work, joan must be a beloved heroine. in this portrayal, she does not endear herself to the viewer. contrarily, she is a disturbing and off-putting character. for this reason i rated it a 7/10, though it easily qualified as a filmmaking 9 or 10.", "the film opens terribly with small, fast-scrolling revisionist history in an ersatz medieval script superimposed on a nearly featureless map of a northern coastline, presumably somewhere in europe. french place names compete for our attention as blood seeps over the obscure territory, presumably representing english invasion. all this when a simple date would tell us as much as we need to know. then there is a wonderful series of establishing shots, rendering all the previous text unnecessary. here is medieval agrarian france, here is the title character, here, her conflicted relationships with the church & god, the ambiguity of what is real, what is visionary. a melange of differing accents alerts us that we are dealing with an ensemble cast. then john malkovich, faye dunaway, and dustin hoffman remind us again. americans in medieval france...hmmm. of the three, dunaway seems the most at home in her role. hoffman...does anyone ever forget he is watching hoffman? jack crabb is the last role i saw as a character and not hoffman-in-a-role. my point isn't to disparage his acting, but that the casting director has placed too-high-profile actors in supporting roles. with hoffman, the question is never what will the character do next, but rather, what will hoffman do with the character. milla is nearly perfect for the part - wild eyed volatile delusional virginal zealot, not much different from her roles in other films (fifth element). but one almost waits for her to go off on a rant in ukrainian. has a french actress ever played this role in an english language film? i liked the props and most of the sets. much of the photography is beautiful, but there is a visually disturbing lack of roads leading to some of the castles. and in the end, the story runs down without reaching a memorable conclusion. or maybe i dozed off.", "the combination of luc besson and mila jojovich is a recipe for criticism. as in, \"oh sure the star is the directors wife\". that would be true if luc besson was anything less than a great director or mila jojovich anything less than a great actress. this film accomplished a lot. visually spectacular, historically challenging, and in many ways ingenious. most of all, it didn't fall prey to the unconditional hero worship or unquestioning belief that most films about moving historical figures do. the film maintains it's historical modesty, questioning rather than preaching or glorifying. if you are looking for a moving, spiritual, emotional movie it's got all that. if you are looking for medieval warfare in all it's glory, it's got all that.but sadly it is flawed. much to my chagrin, as i do admire most of his work, dustin hoffman's performance is, to put it mildly, a big downer for the film. he is clearly at a loss as to what his character or purpose is in the film. his performance is uncomfortable and distracting. despite his lower appearance in the credits, his role was critical in the film. it's a real detractor. but aside from this one glaring flaw, the film is of the highest quality on all accounts. i was riveted from beginning to end and wouldn't hesitate to watch it again. because of it's one casting/directing flaw i have to rate it an 8 but on every other count it's a 10.", "one thing about this movie....the battle scenes are awesome. they are done so effectively that you feel like you are there screaming with the rest of them as you charge against the enemy. part of this is the director, luc besson's magic of vision, but most of it can be attributed to the explosion of emotion that comes from mila jovovich, who plays the lead.with these two forces it produces a very emotional film that takes us to a place we have seldom seen in popular movie releases in the past few years.this is the oft told story of joan of arc and her life during a very turbulent time and how she led the french to defeating the english when a woman of this time would never have done such a thing.my only one detraction is some of the structure. namely the movie races along for 2 hours, then it stops cold. this is when she has been captured and now faces death, and this is where dustin hoffman comes in to the act portraying her conscience. i don't have anything wrong with hoffman's performance, but it is notable that this is when the the whole movie screeches to a halt and that is what i remember feeling at the time.somehow, since besson uses many instances of flashbacks through her eyes, i would have been happier perhaps, if he had taken some moments to let hoffman's character infect her soul in more instances throughout the movie. i find it a bit hard to believe that this woman who so struggles with her every being and emotion doesn't have her conscience there constantly making her doubt what is driving her in the first place. especially since her conscience takes such an active role in the final 30 minutes.that aside, i haven't felt this much intensity rise to the level it does from a character in a movie the way jovovich's performance has evoked me. she is so taken in with her character that you find yourself engrossed and going through every feeling she gives off on screen. it's as if you could feel how much her heart was racing, as her eyes bulge out of their sockets when she screams for support from her army. or even when she sprouts tears from being so burdened with all that she is carrying, they seem to flow with no way for her to stop them. it was something.if you get a chance, this is well worth a look.", "i cannot fathom some of the glowing reviews this film is receiving. i really, really, really didn't like this movie at all. don't get me wrong, i've always found joan of arc to be a fascinating historical figure. but why on earth did she have to be portrayed like someone on *****? more than anything, i'm just disappointed at this film for the way it was made. i feel that there was so much more that could have been done, but the lousy dialogue and poor directing just made seeing this film a bad experience.", "this is not a movie i would have chosen, but director luc besson has \"valerian\" coming out soon, and this movie was mentioned in a review. there are reviews written by people with far greater knowledge. i have a casual understanding of the story of joan of arc, and know less about the events of the time. as a movie, i enjoyed this immensely. this movie gets the people right.milla javovich hits it perfectly. she is vulnerable while unstoppable. she is full of doubt, but completely certain. and during the trial, she can do \"caged animal\" with just her eyes. i can't imagine anyone else pulling this off. milla does unapologetically devote better than anyone since audrey hepburn in \"the nun's story\".the supporting cast did a stellar job. there are a lot of medieval movies and tv shows, and most of them aren't believable because people aren't stern or earnest all the time. \"game of thrones\" is fun to watch because sometimes people laugh, and sometimes they fight. if you ever saw a medieval movie, and wondered what the guard standing next to the door does when the camera and the king aren't there, this movie has it. some reviews called that filler, but it was fun and humanized the soldiers.i gave it a 10 because it showed people in a way different than other medieval movies. again, i don't know if the historical facts are correct, but i would not be surprised if the people acted just like they are portrayed.", "when you have a subject like the story of jeanne d'arc(she was french so i use her french name), you can do a lot of things. besson tried to make an epic movie with an ending which would analyze what happened. this is a very interesting approach, but i personally believe that the movie could have lasted 20 more minutes. besson spent too much time fighting and not enough time analyzing. but the fight scenes are still very well shot, as is the rest of the movie. something that i found strange is that besson is a director which has a style of his own. i believe i could recognize a besson movie just by the style of it. but not this one. it is his most american movie to date, and i didn't feel his style as much. then again, maybe it's just because jean reno didn't have at least a cameo... let's return to the directing. it is very dynamic and appropriate for the movie. the acting was a mixed bag. for example, milla jovovich was perfect in some scenes, but in others, she was not totally convincing. faye dunaway was not bad, but she was not very good either. malkovich was good as charles vii, and i like the way he portrayed him as a coward and a puppet with no will to decide on his own. still, i think he could have been even better. the only one who was perfect was dustin hoffman. when jeanne was fire, he was ice. i liked the scenes he and milla had together, has besson tried to give use a choice between mad jeanne and saint jeanne. i think he believes in mad jeanne, but he doesn't close the other theory. the supporting cast was okay. still, i think this movie could have been better with a longer period in the prisons. all in all, if you are interested in history, this is a movie you should see.74%", "the concept of the story of the maid of lorraine was prime material for a epic of \"ten commandments\" proportion. unfortunately it opened on the heels of a tv mini-series which may have stolen some of its thunder. the cinematography was excellent and the battle scenes were as gory as those in saving private ryan - probably very much as they actually were. most of the supporting actors were excellent. the \"poetic license\" that was taken with the real story took away from the intent of the movie. the \"mystical scenes\" where joan was hearing voices or getting spiritual revelations were more like natural born killers meet the dark ages. oliver stone must have been consulted on these. the historical inaccuracies were abundant, such at the disgusting rape of joan's sister, which she, in actuality, did not have. we know little of the appearance of the relevations she had, but i am sure they were nothing like depicted - which evidently had some hidden meaning that the average movie goer will never be able to figure out.the movie was destroyed by the mila jovovich as joan. most of the scences with her resembled footage from the blair witch project more than a portrayal of st. joan of arc. she has little acting ability and her overdone performance absolutely ruined the movie. i do not feel that someone as strong as joan and as religiously committed would have continually been on the verge of hysteria almost to the point of having a seizure.i still do not know what compelled me to sit through the whole movie. i have not seen anything this bad since the early 1980's remake of 1984.had the movie paid more attention to historical data, de-emphasized those \"speculated\" vision scenes, and used a legitimate actress - like leelee sobieski in the tv mini-series - this movie would have been a great success.this movie portrayed joan as a confused, hysterical, psychotic. the real joan would have never been able to accomplish what she did, even to the point of being martyred with such spiritual and confident serenity if she was actually like the movie joan.use your bonus rental at your favorite video store rather than pay good money to see this bit of glitzy trash.", "with france at the mercy of english invaders, a young woman, haunted by visions from god, approaches charles vii and begs him to give her an army on the basis of her visions. he yields to her faith and soon battles begun to be won due to her inspired approach to the war. however with the english on the retreat and charles crowned king of france, the tone of the country changes and joan is desired more by the english for revenge than she is by the french rulers for her victories.i came to this with an awareness of the bad reviews and i must admit that many of them have been rather harsh. perhaps it is your expectation  i had no hopes that this would be anything other than a film and am already very accustom to `historical' films being far from the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. so all i expected was a reasonable film which was watchable and, in fairness, that's all i got.as often is the case with besson, the substance is very much second to style and thus the story is historically very dubious at best. happily the style and delivery of the film is all and he does direct it well. the battle scenes are exciting without being as grand as we've seen it done elsewhere. when it comes down to the politics of the beast then the film falters a bit and besson can't deliver something that is compelling. the last 30 minutes are a real drag and are only really redeemed by one (surprising) factor. contrary to the other reviews here  that factor was dustin hoffman.while i agree that another actor could have done better, hoffman does a good job on the most part. his cynicism helps dispel the myth that had been build up in the previous 2 hours and is quite refreshing to have questions asked instead of just fighting. he is a strange choice but i think his new york sceptic approach works (despite being set in medieval france). he certainly works better than many others in the cast. jovovich is a beautiful blonde-haired, blue eyes peasant girl with a perfect accent and mannerisms  one would have hoped she would have at least tried to be a peasant rather than a warrior princess but ho-hum. she can't carry the role for the majority of the film and is not a good enough actress. however other better actors also flounder with malkovich just having a laugh, cassel almost being a warrior clown and dunaway looking sinister behind the scenes.overall this is stylish enough to watch once but for god's sake don't expect a really good film, a thoughtful film or one that bares anything but a passing resemblance to the real joan d'arc.", "luc besson's film about the life of the relatively recently sainted joan of arc is remarkably muddled. it is never seems to know what it wants to say about it's heroine. that isn't necessarily bad if it is intended but in this film it doesn't work. visually, of course, it is beautiful, but luc besson can do that in his sleep. it is the muddled content that i have a problem with. we are given no real window into the mind of joan, and the manner in which we experience her religious revelations doesn't really allow us to question them in the way many of the other characters do. it could be argued that in certain key sequences besson does encourage us to doubt her visions or at least her interpretation. so i will leave that aside. and maybe i am also hung up on the films lack of perspective on joan herself. it never takes a clear stance on what it thinks of her. great hero? or maybe flawed angry woman (whose main goal is revenge) who so wants to drive the english out of france she will find the signs from god to do it. i think this latter vision is the one we are intended to adopt. the only really inspired portion of the film (the talk between joan and god) leads us to this postition. i wonder if the whole idea for the film didn't start with this scene between joan and god (who is played wonderfully by dustin hoffman, critical, somewhat cruel, witty (a trait not often allowed by screenwriters), maybe caring in the way of parents). i wonder if the film might not have played better as a 45 or 30 minute short film revolving around the key scenes with god and joan. i have one other complaint, and this one may seem petty. why not go with the french language for a film about french history instead of english with french accents?", "this is a good film. i wouldn't venture to say that it's the best, because it's not. it's definatly worth seeing for history buffs (though i would heavilly question it's historical accuraccy.) it does however have a heafty dose of one of the things i dislike about besson's work, there sometimes isn't enough contrast between tension and a lack thereof. this is especially the case in the messenger. i would recommend this, but be advised: besson's other works (the professional, nikita) are much, much better.", "i was very disappointed by eric serra's music. if it had a great score, it would have been a lot better. eric serra makes great music. i don't understand what happened here.", "okay, so maybe milla jovovich wasn't the best choice for the lead.... most reviews i have read treated this movie as if it was an all out disaster. sometimes blasphemous, sometimes painful to watch, sometimes a bit too strange, but always captivating, this is a movie that deserves to be recognized. there's some stunning cinematography and startling dream sequences. the costumes, set design, and battle scenes are as good as anything found in braveheart. in the end, this is kind of a feminist braveheart on acid. and yes, it does run a bit too long, but the burning at the stake scene at the end is worth the wait, as wretched as it may be to imagine. give it a shot. it deserves to be watched and beheld, if not beloved. 7/10.", "milla jovovich may have been the only woman who could have portrayed a 'joan' believable enough for such a film and approach as that taken by luc besson, one which stops just short of suggesting some sort of 'shamanic visionary' as opposed to a character labelled everything from 'deranged schizophrenic' to 'lesbian', simply due to attire, while 'hearing voices' (all historical facts). the key ingredient: the eyes. not since faye dunnaway's unforgetable portrayal in \"the eyes of laura mars\" (1976), who coincidentally co-stars as an excellent yolande d'aragon herewith, has someone captivated an audience simply by a look or a glance. spell-binding, riveting, and as true to the historical record as one can expect for this most noble of french heroines, while adding a plausible childhood, besson, jovovich, an excellent supporting cast and the film were all but ignored for the honours they so richly deserved. rating five stars (of five) and a film i'll never forget!", "i can take nothing away from the actors and actresses in this movie. john malkovich, milla jovovich, faye dunaway and dustin hoffman were excellent in this movie. i was very impressed with milla jovovich's strong portrayal of joan of arc. can you believe this woman does modeling and sings? let's see cindy crawford or claudia shiffer do this kind of acting. even though \"the fifth element\" wasn't the greatest movie, milla still gave a credible preformance. she also wasn't bad in \"he got game\" either. in any case, this movie was different in many ways. the director (luc besson) used many visual dreamscapes to tell the story of how the lord gave joan a message to visit the soon to be king charles, form an army and defeat the english. of course no one believes her until she succeeds in leading the french army through blockades and taking over forts.yes the movie is a bit confusing. you see visuals of clouds, fields of flowers with joan running through them, the lord sitting in a stone chair, and other misconceptions of a message coming from the heavens. you really don't understand the whole thing until the end of the movie. then again, you still may not understand it. the war scenes are very violent and bloody. lots of decapitations and limbs flying everywhere. this movie is a bit long too. it's about 155 mins., when it should have been about 130 mins. many of those dream sequences could have been cut shorter and some of the fight scenes could have been cut back. but overall, the movie was decent and worth seeing.", "how can one say that this is an honest and open-minded approach to joan of arc's character? the reason for her \"revenge\" is not historically accurate. joan is portrayed as a raving maniac who eventually makes the viewer wonder why she would ever be canonized a saint. this movie is in short a huge time waster. the ingrid bergman version is the movie to see if one wishes get a more realistic glimpse of joan's true character.", "joan of arc the legend which was described as saint, warrior, frantic, heretic etc. is brilliantly played by milla jovovich. this movie isn't the typical hero stuff you would expect. it has many sides to think of and gives you space to make your own thoughts about the character joan of arc. and that is exactly what i liked the most about the movie. you can almost feel what this very young woman must have felt to be on the battlefield at this age, fighting for her vision, faith or whatever it was. intoxicated by the battles and her mission to fight the war for god, for france. besides from that you will see a lot of battles. great visuals and good to memorable acting.most people seem to get the movie wrong. they probably wanted a clean hero saga or some documentary movie, i don't know. this movie is something different. sometimes you have to read between the lines, make your own thoughts. but as i said, that's what i like and that's what i want from a good movie.10/10", "this movie could have faired better without so much time spent on jeanne's (joan of arc's) formative years. less time and effort should have went into the greusome battle scenes and more time spent on getting the best possible performances out of the actors, especially jeanne(milla jovovich) and charles vi (john malkovich). did we really need to see all the various ways to better kill someone in a movie about a girls faith in god and her countrymen's willingness to follow her?)all i saw john malkovich do was whine and carry on like a snivelling child. dustin hoffman's character was not needed, and the director had no clue how to best show jeanne's faith and devotion to god appear believable. even the greatest actors need a good director to bring out the best in them. so if anything goes wrong in a movie, it is ultimately the director's fault. otherwise, it was a decent movie.charle's brother and his knights were my favorite characters. how else do you act when your brother sends you this seemingly crazy girl, who is either recieving godly vissions or possiblly suffering from halucinations (caused by brain tumors,maybe?), to lead your troops against the much larger brittish army of invaders?i gave it a 6 out of 10, because i liked king charle's brother and his elite guard so much. (10 being \"godfather\" quality, 1 being \"manos, hands of fate\" or \"ace ventura >take your pick, both ventura movie's sucked<\" bad.)", "i saw a comment that said that if joan of arc could see this movie, she would turn in her grave (if she had some). i must fully agree with it. although i am no joan's biographer, the facts that i know from her life were so deformed here that i wonder why frenchmen didn't burn the director on a stockpile instead of her. by the way, i must laugh, when i remember the concealment around the filming of besson's joan in northern moravia. no man including martians could get there. why did they actually hide there? perhaps they wanted to keep back from people, what a trash they are just shooting.besson and his exwife allegedly undertook a deep investigation (only gods know, where) and this french-ukrainian collaboration resulted in a title, where joan of arc is \"demythicized\" and depicted as a furious psychotic, who runs through the screen with a staring look and even beats her soldiers with a fist (yes, here it is really possible). poor villagers at the trial in rouen probably lied and besson with jovovich revealed a big historical fraud. one thing that i can't understand is why there are so many people that can call this unbelievable garbage \"a moving masterpiece\". maybe there is a lot of ignorants, who know nothing about the historical reality and maybe they have only a foggy idea about the position of france, but despite that i can't believe that somebody could think that french soldiers could follow a lunatic like this.i am very sorry for director marshall, who also planned a movie about joan, but he was probably forced to put off its realization because of this silly emanation that was quicker. the joan with leelee sobieski was certainly better, but leelee simply lacks enough charisma (although otherwise she is a very pretty and sympathetic girl, of course.)maybe besson will soon make a similar biographical movie about mother theresa, where he will definitively demythicize her as a deviant monster abusing little indian children. i am looking forward to positive comments on this exciting masterpiece.", "the messenger was by far one of the true epics of the late nineties. the actors in this film had great dialog. i think that the medieval battle scenes were some of the greatest ever shot. dustin hoffman should be up for an academy award for his brief but powerful performance and the conscience. supremly powerful acting there. though i must say that john malkovich was poorly cast as the king. it was just not a role for him. the soundtrack is powerful. not to sound sick but the music that was played during her execution was powerful and added well to the emotion of the scene.all in all...i give this film. 9/10.", "this is a film that could, and should, have been an oscar contender. a modern big-screen adaptation of the story of joan of arc has the potential to blow even braveheart out of the water. this one, however, won't manage it.there are certainly some strong performances, including by milla jovovich, who does have the presence to play the part. unfortunately, while she plays it with presence, she also plays it wrong. her joan of arc is so twitchy that it is almost impossible to believe that anybody would even think she could merit an audience with the dauphin, much less command an army.the largest problem lies with the storytelling itself. the first hour and forty-five minutes has gaping holes in the narrative and it is difficult to see how the characters portrayed get from point a to point b. once joan is captured the narrative finally flows smoothly, but the end result feels as though the film was originally at least an hour longer and it was cut in the most artistic manner possible. they should have left it in; this film is at least an hour too short to tell the story.final mark: 3.5/5.", "luc besson succeeds to capture the passion, the spiritual acceleration and the mystery of the world of joan of arc. the cinematography was done excellent including the acting from milla jovovich as the young joan of arc. this is what i call a \"modern\" film where the visual effect enhances the emotional and spiritual conflicts of the actors.the director's representation of the truth of the christian faith and joan's spiritual gifts is however abstract, vague and sometimes spooky. i doubt the historical accuracy of joan's personal agony being portrayed in the movie.", "another viewer says:\" i watched this movie mostly because me and my brother have a small argument over which joan of arc movie we bothered to pick as our fav. the leelee sobieski version or this version. \"along with these recent films, it's worth mentioning two major icons of film history that deal with jeanne: dreyer's 1928 \"la passion de jeanne d'arc\" ( and bresson's 1962 \"le procès de jeanne d'arc\" (", "some movies would probably try to make a more divine spirit out of joan but at least besson examines all possibilities as regards to what inspired her. i think it was as honest a film you could make about joan. her quest for revenge combined with tremendous belief in the forces above that ignited her fire. through dustin hoffman the viewer can question her motives and get her response. and what a performance! milla was simply breathtaking as joan.", "this time the film is just a pretext for what i want to share. i will express it in a few moments.the period of time which indicates the film is one of the essential ones for the further historical development. these are process of awakening from the influence of church and shaping of national states in the forms in which we know them today.joan of arc marks the full expression of faith in good and proper, faith in the church which no longer follows the tenets properly. joan fully believe in god and adhere to church rules. she live as \"should be\" but she meets no support, she meet the stake.on the other hand her military actions are amazing. maybe that's what people need - hysterical constancy that does not comply with rules, norms and has no tact. i was whole goosebumps when i saw how she used the military facility for seize of the fortress. definitely what she saw was not entirely reasonable but that was the surprise that brought victory.true story or not, it is a significant example of how different can be views on same issues. about how unclean seems from aside the desire to succeed at all costs and be saved as position, not as person.", "the story of joan is a good one on its own. to take the legend and twist it not only to unglorify joan to a raving lunatic, but also to unglorify god is just a waste of time and money. the special effects were so laughable. a man's head was cut off with blood spurting out and all i could do was laugh. the visuals reminded me of the likes of the bad drug trip scene in easy rider. haven't special effects been updated since then? lastly, isn't it time we did away with useless rape scenes? it would be enough to have family members killed off and a village burned to make a leading character angry enough to want revenge. seems to me that besson has some personal issues to seek counseling for.", "we are already used to the original depictions lus besson did of humans on screen. how would he do with real events this time? i'm happy to say he suceeded. we are somewhat used to the regular \"automatic pilot\" depictions of joan's life, the woman who loved god above all things and believed she was sent to save her people from the clutches of the british. but here we are entitled to a much more personal point of view: besson's eye for milla is particularly sensible, and we notice she as a particular shine no other character has. therefore, we establish an empathy with her which starts even when she is only a child. the movie has a great period detail, and some incredible sequences, but, for some reason, it is the film by besson that grabbed me the least, i can't explain why, although that isn't saying that i didn't like. in fact, i think there are things about this movie i haven't seen nowhere else, specially all the scenes where joan hallucinates and has visions of god. this movie is totally different from all medieval adventures we have seen so far, and its shots are luc besson's own. the all-stellar cast helps a lot, and dustin hoffman turn out welcome at the end. the battle scenes are a wow!thierry arboghast's cinematography helps a lot to establish a cool look of medieval times, specially when fire is concerned. eric serra's score reaches depth levels he has never reached before. a great film altogether, which deserves to be seen with the heart willing to take whatever we get from it. the title song \"my heart calling\" is one of the most beautiful eric serra wrote for the movies. i recommend it for besson fans who will like certainly, and to all the others who aren't, just for the fun of a different depiction of joan's life.", "for being a film that is slightly above average, it contains performances that alone saves this film from being too light on the subject. milla jovovich is simply sensational as jeanne d'arc, the savior of orléans, who went to war against the english after having received a message from god.the most exciting part of this film is not the war itself or the intricate dealings that led to jeanne d'arc's demise - but the dialogue between jeanne and her own conscience, aptly played by the man with the voice, dustin hoffman. did she really receive a message from god, or was it the need for revenge that spurred her visions. did she not enjoy the taste of blood in battle? very interesting twist indeed, and that, together with jovovich's amazing acting, keeps this film from falling into the average.", "this movie is just painful. i got halfway through and i had to stop watching. the dialogue is pure schmalz, as is half the imagery. the opening montage of the girl running through the flowers made me want to gag.but the lowest note of this movie? the laughable (and cringe-worthy..) acting by milla jovovich. she rages through this movie like a mad woman possessed, she tends to scream and glare at the camera a lot. to be brutally honest, she's more suited to roles where she doesn't have to speak much and just has to look pretty, like in \"the fifth element\".if you want a fulfilling movie experience about joan of arc, i highly recommend the tv-movie version starring leelee sobieski.", "easily one of the biggest surprises of 1999, \"the messenger\" (gasp!) actually turns out to be a well-crafted film. suffering from tremendous abuse heaped on it--by the same so-called experts who thought \"shakespeare in love\" was the best picture of 1998--it is perhaps the most misjudged film in a long time. but then again, most cinema goers aren't the sage souls you and i are. and most actresses couldn't carry off a masterful performance the way little cosmetics girl milla jovovich did. the girl can act! who woulda thunk it? but the director's ex does her old old man right--this is one of the best performances by any lead, female or male, this year. milla manages to be both captivating, admirable and alluring--adding just the right tinge of tragedy to joan of arc's martyrdom without coming across as holier-than-thou, and at the same time jovo exudes natural confidence and sexuality that had every male in the theatre squirming in his seat.

this alone elevates the film from appalling to ok.", "a very clever screenplay: theologically, psychologically, historically and dramatically almost perfect. you can look at the story of joan of arc in all these four ways and besson did it all four ways. and made a movie that satisfies you and makes you wonder, no matter which of the four is your favorite.this film was a big surprise for me since it had more depth than i could hope for, more energy than action, more drama than spectacle (although it didn't exactly lack spectacle!) dustin hoffman and mila jovovich give brilliant performances. i rate this movie 9 out of 10.", "the messenger: the story of joan of arc is a visually ambitious and intense retelling of the legendary figure's life, but it struggles with tonal inconsistency. the battle sequences are raw and immersive, showcasing luc besson's talent for striking cinematography and large-scale action. however, the film's storytelling lacks the depth needed to make joan's journey as emotionally compelling as it should be.milla jovovich delivers a passionate performance, but at times, her portrayal feels overly exaggerated, making it difficult to connect with the character on a deeper level. the supporting cast, including john malkovich and dustin hoffman, adds weight to the film, but the uneven pacing and occasional over-the-top direction keep it from reaching its full potential. while the messenger has its moments of brilliance, it ultimately falls short of being a truly definitive take on joan of arc's story.", "this film is totally without any redeeming features. it is slow, tedious and woefully over-acted. if should accidentally rent this thing from the local video library i can assure you that the best part of this movie is rewinding it at the end.", "the messenger, the story of joan of arc, is a historical epic full of vibrant, fleeting images that interpret the emotional origin, thoughts, and possible decent into madness of a historical figure normally bound within the confines of religious myth. the film, directed by luc besson, masterfully examines the psyche of joan, portraying her as human rather than a cliche heroine. it is evident that besson thrives on portraying this time in france's history to be as accurate and as brutal as historians agree it would have been. many of the images are bloody and raw, however; they are never unimaginative. the symbolism, although at times obvious, is never less than pleasing to the eye. the photography and composition always carefully constructed as to please even novice audiences. if the film has flaws, it comes mostly from the script. co-written by besson himself, it has strengths while examining joan, but weakens considerably when dealing with minor characters such as the the dauphin/king, his mother-in-law, and most importantly joan's comrades in arms. this makes the transition from hostile soldiers to devout believers too fast to completely accept. the most intriguing/compelling point in the script comes when dustin hoffman's character (termed \"conscience\" by many)enters. wearing the masks of innocence, divinity, and death, this \"angel\" of joan's own creation does not weaken the film, but rather; does what thought-provoking scenes should- raise more questions than they answer. milla puts on a stunning performance if you view her as a young woman teetering on the edge of madness. if you're looking for a heroine that never bruises and never questions her mission, this may not be the film for you. overall a 9 rating from this film-lover.", "being french, i used to make fun of besson and his films, although i never had seen any one of them in a theatre. so i went to see his jeanne d'arc, which had received rather good critics, even from his usual enemies. what a bore! it is really awful! you can actually see 3 parts in the movie. the first one is when jeanne is young. it is completely silly, full of horrible special effects when she has visions. then come the battles, the less worse of the parts. too bad besson feels like he has to show us a head or arm being cut with a sword every two seconds. finally, the trial, with the conscience explaining us in an hour what we'd understood in a minute. despairingly long. perhaps i'll give besson another chance in 20 years. till then, i'll know what i make fun of.", "milla and the ensemble cast take the story of joan of arc to another level.religious violence tempered with humanity as joan realizes just what she has started with her war against the english king. i was taken in by the rampaging yet deceptively naive joan (played by milla) and went with the tide (as did the others following joan) only to find myself alone and uncomfortable at the denouement. luc besson has shown us both sides of joan - devout yet vengeful-humane yet terrifying. congratulations to the cast and crew on a truly satisfying movie", "i think the french film has always been the most powerful rival the american film. the french make art films,commercial films, action films, adventure films, romantic films, historic films cartoons etc. in 60s-80s years much more films were made, and there were a lot of excellent directors and big stars. in 90s almost only luc besson can direct such commercial films that are successful in other countries in europe or in north america. he has focused on scenes, dynamic plotdriving but has showed the deep of soul and let the audience think. at the same time (think about leon the pro, grand blue, subway). he has directed sci-fi, fifth element also of which has not had so many fans as star wars has had, but in europe, in hungary for example, we liked it. now he decided to make a film about the darkest part of the french history. reviewers said that his approaching to the subject is different from the previous ones. luc besson directed this film as a commercial filmdirector would have done. he focused on the scenes of apparitions and the war. the life (in her childhood her family were massacred by the british) and religion explains why she wants to ask the expectant king for giving her army, saying she will save the country. this joan of arc is self-confident and shy at the same time. she has got not any experience how to lead an army but she knows -she thinks-what god says. of course the soldiers will not accept jeanne d'arc as general but because of victories she will have more and more influence. but after the deciding battle she is also horrified from the view of a lot of died men, blood, limbs. even the king betrays her when she is not needed. she will be indecisive, frightened, even she will have to struggle herself conscience. this conscience is a small boy at the beginning of the film then will be a matured, adult man. this is the most interesting and impressed moment of the film. jeanne d'arc asks her conscience about her religion, her truth, her responsible. with her the viewer also attains to the total/complete scepticism. but i am sad about this film. i feel insecure of luc besson. in his film people speak english not french, which is sometimes fun or strange during the film and big american actors are involved. i heard people in usa hate the subtitles and they don't watch film in foreign language. maybe luc besson made this film for american. he selected american actors. dustin hoffman , faye dunaway, jonn malkovich who are brilliant in their roles. i particularly impressed by dustin hoffman. with his beard he he has got charisma, he is a really alive conscience. but it should have been worth selecting somebody american actress for role of joan of arc who would have been more convincing, because milla is not convincing for me, and i didn't enjoy the film because of her. when jeanne d'arc (joan of arc) should have been determined, self-confident milla is not so determined, convincing. she is not charismatic enough for this role . as a hungarian reviewer said milla was good as the fifth element but not as jeanne d'arc. but it would have been the best if luc besson would have remained a hundred per cent french director. this film would have been very good. the scenes, the plot, the approaching to the subject are interesting and understandable and captivate. but the whole movie is not put together somehow. now it is fashion that the successful directors, actors go to usa because there are money there. they try to make a type of american films and lost their identity. there are very few directors who are able to repeat the same success what they had got before, in \"the old world\". maybe luc besson will come home to europe, to france.", "when luc besson took on the legendary life of joan of arc, he did so with a big budget and a cast of thousands. the movie, unlike his previous movie, failed to light up american audiences while french audiences loved it. it didn't make a lot of money like fifth element did or even lucy later on, yet it's an underrated movie about a famous woman who became a role model for generations of french women. the soundtrack is good, and the shots are amazing. unlike his previous movie, this one is rated r, just like the professional, yet it deals with religious themes.", "this film had lots of pretty shots and an interesting subject matter, but somehow -- in the 2.5 hrs of screentime available to the script writers -- they managed to fail to develop any of the characters so that they were of any great interest. i felt pretty detached from the characters, for the most part. the dialog was largely uninspiring. the characters never really show you what they are made of. even jean d'arc's character seemed painfully one-dimensional. since we all know how the story ends, you would think that there would be some attempt to put some juiciness in the middle, but this just wasn't there. the way they resort to brief flashbacks to fill in some of the most interesting parts of the story is disappointing. this film was impressive in some ways, but it could have been so much better! a partial, but not total disappointment.", "i wanted to see this one at the movies, but after hearing it was no good from what i considered good sources, i decided against it. having seen it at the dvd-rental store many times, often almost grabbing it, but deciding against it remembering how horrible it was supposed to be. finally one day, finding nothing else, i rented it. and i loved it! it is great, finding jewels unexpectedly like this, as when one watches as many films as i do, the only great films you see are the newest ones. after watching it, i went to the user comment area here on imdb and tried to find out why people have given it such low rating. further more, this was an oscar performance from milla jovovich, but apparently the film wasn't even nominated (based on what i can see here on imdb). this film is in the category, `either you get it, or you don't', or `either you love it or hate it'. i didn't know anything about joan of arc, and maybe that is why i liked it, watching it as a film rather then historical documentary. the film leaves me with a comfortable feeling. before i watched it, i was afraid that we would see some saint of a woman, and how un-human and holy she was in what she did. instead we see a young woman, plagued with the notion of purpose, extreme determination, while never fully understanding why or what is happening. joan of arc is much more of a hero to me after seeing this film, because the film is about her as a woman, rather then some supernatural being. 9/10", "i know next to nothing about the joan of arc story, but i've liked luc besson's work, and the trailer was terrific, so i was looking forward to this movie, even after the bad reviews. as might be expected from a besson film, it looked incredible. the battle scenes were all well-handled, and as the warrior joan, jovovich was quite convincing. the rest of the movie was something else again.it seems to me besson and his co-writer, andrew birkin, were trying to do what kenneth branagh did in his version of hamlet; look at the lead character not as an icon, but as a normal human being, and try to explain their actions and behavior in that context. admittedly, since i am unfamiliar with this story, i am more receptive to this approach than those who hold joan as an icon, but i would have been more than willing to watch a movie which handled this material well. unfortunately, once besson established which way he wanted to go, he seemed unsure of how to get there. most of the drama is handled on a third-grade level(especially her trial), and we never really get into what made joan tick. though the scenes with dustin hoffman were involving, especially since he was so good, they too fell short in explaining joan. and jovovich can't quite access those depths yet.the rest of the cast is okay. malkovich and faye dunaway are playing types, but they play them well enough. tchecky kayro(i know i'm not spelling that right) and vincent cassel lend a sense of gravity to their roles as soldiers. but all in all, this is a movie whose reach was beyond its grasp.", "i have seen a few other adaptations of the joan of arc story. this one was the best. i liked the special effects. the acting was convincing. this movie kept me interested the entire time i was watching it. you must see this movie.", "the messanger, in my opinion, is a very unique and well made historical piece (despite how inaccurate it might be). milla jovovich plays joan as a very ignorent and quite annoying women as i would imagine her to be. what i hated about the film is that i walked away confused and rather un happy about the ending. the movie made me detest religeon even more because it seemed so corrupt, confusing and primitive. dustin hoffmans character was very interesting but i felt it left me to torn in the end.", "luc besson was about to become one of my favorite film directorsof all time before he came up with the mediocre 5th element andthis just plain awful joan of arc movie. my worst fear was thatheroin chic in her late 20's supermodels wouldn't do goodteenage virgins. my worst fears were problem true: jovovich hasto be the worst joan yet, with most of her representation comingfrom the school of over-acting. she's screaming and burstinginto tears in almost every line she uttered. of course, thescript didn't help her at all.the main problem in the script is the lack of characterbackground and/or motivation. if there was any, it was toovague. joan evolves from a screaming warrior, to a reluctantcheerleader, to a peace advocate, in minutes. you don't care forneither character, including the leading role, at any timeduring the movie. actually this is the joan of arc movie whereyou can't wait for her to burn.i'm sorry about luc's fans, but he should keep doing moviesabout french professional assassins rather than this. earlierthis year, a mediocre cbs mini series you could watch for free,beat this movie to a pulp.", "luc besson's take on st. joan as a confused, possibly schitzophrenic, religious fanatic whose victories against the english having as much to do with revenge for the murder of her sister as her religious beliefs is certainly interesting. he portrays her not as a great fighter, but as a flawed but inspiring leader and lateral thinker.but not a leader in the same sense as, say, mel gibson's william wallace in braveheart. she believes she is following the signs of god, though her motives are dubious to say the least. you feel that she is just using the french army for her own murderous revenge and not just the good of her country.as a result, the long and very bloody battles against the english do not have the same sense of victory as in braveheart. in fact they leave a bad taste in the mouth, as they are meant to.milla jovovich is simply stunning as the angry, confused teenager. i have only seen her in resident evil and have grown to love her style of acting, which is a crossover between theatrical and naturalistic. she can portray kick-ass strength whilst showing great vulnerability and naivity. a fine actress, though not to everyone's taste it seems.even dustin hoffman, an actor who never fails to irritate me, (except in midnight cowboy, his finest hour), gives a terrifically restrained performance as joan's inner conscience, and is excellent as a result.faye dunaway gives a fine understated performance, yet, surprisingly enough, it is john malkovich who lets the team down somewhat. though he doesn't spoil the movie, you know he's done better work elsewhere.as a movie, it moves along at good pace, though anyone expecting a feel good movie like braveheart beware. joan of arc is not a heart-warming tale of an underdog country's victory over the tyrannical english. this is a very affecting portrait of a flawed individual who may have used the lives of a few thousand countrymen to do battle with her own inner demons, who by chance helped lead them into liberation.a fine movie with enough good performances for repeated viewings.", "this movie is still a luc besson movie but it is was much influenced by the hollywood style. though it is principally a story in the french national history it was nevertheless americanized à la \"braveheart\". i liked many things in it, especially the pictures, they still have the fascinating style of luc in many scenes. concerning the actors i think that milla jovovich was not suitable for this role. she was too soft for it. perhaps a french actress would have been more suitable! the other interesting aspect of this movie was the interpretation of the visions and the role of her \"conscience\". it was free to the interpretation whether these visions were from god or just hallucinations! movies and arts in general should have enough room for fantasy like in this film. in short this movie is worth seeing, although i could imagine different reactions about it especially in europe.", "joan of arc, a cinematic tapestry that weaves history, heroism, and heart with a mesmerizing performance by the lead actress. the portrayal of joan is a tour de force, capturing the complexity of a young woman thrust into a divine mission. the film editing gracefully navigates through the tumultuous events of joan's life, offering a compelling narrative that balances the intimate moments of introspection with the grandeur of battles. the strength of joan of arc lies in its commitment to portraying the human side of a legendary figure, showcasing vulnerability alongside valor. while the music subtly enhances the emotional beats, there are moments where the pacing feels a tad uneven. cinematography, however, paints a vivid canvas, transporting the audience to medieval landscapes and battlefields. at 7/10, joan of arc is a captivating exploration of faith and courage, a film that brings an iconic historical figure to life with sincerity and grace.", "joan of arc (1999) was a mila jovovich one woman show. she stars as the near mythical joan of arc. an illiterate teenage peasant girl who becomes a lighting rod for french independence and the many force of driving the english interlopers from france. the hundred years war has dragged on a tad longer than a hundred years. france is in a desperate state of collapsing altogether, the dauphin (john malkovich) is in seclusion in southern france watching his kingdom erode. he hears about a young peasant girl (mila jovovich) who has says that god wants him to rule a united france. with nothing to lose, he grants her an audience and the rest is history....not to be taken as the final truth. please remember this is a historical fiction. if you want to learn more about the real joan of arc i suggest you read up on medieval europe or just go to your local library. co-stars faye dunaway, dustin hoffman, vincent cassel and tcheky kairo. should have been a french language production. that would have been cool.highly recommended.", "i gave this movie a 6 out of 10.ever wanted to know what it feels like to be trapped in a bad dream? if you like bad dreams then you will

background.overview:this is a long movie, over two and a half hours i think. and in some ways it is pleasing to watch... your eyes will love this movie:there is a lot of dream imagery in this movie:oh, look at her run through the field of green flowers, and now red flowers, and now blue flowers, and now yellow flowers, and let's not forget the purple flowers. how about some pretty clouds too? yes, you get to see almost ten minutes of cloud footage. happy clouds, sad clouds, angry clouds... you name them this movie has 'em. more eye-candy! yes, there is blood, blood, and more blood. even the maps bleed in this movie. how many ways can you kill someone without modern weapons? answer: see this movie and you will know. okay, okay, they might have left one or two ways out but that is it. slow motion! the movie wouldn't have nearly taken so long if it played at full speed. but since half of it is a dream you have to watch that half in sllooowwww motion...i must admit listening to everyone talk is fun. there is one warrior whose voice is so impressive i want to give this movie a 7 instead of a 6. and joan's voice is good too.and that was the good part...your brain will hate this movie:the movie gets a lot of things wrong by trying to do too much. in the end it does a lot of things, but none of them. it builds up a way of looking at something, only to turn around and tear it down. and again in the end there isn't much left. of her army or of the movie...it could have had a really cool king arthur knights of the round table kind of story where the hero is the chosen instrument of god sent to set things right and save the king and the country. now wouldn't that have been nice and worth seeing, but no... amazingly nothing ever happens to the characters you dislike. the manipulating step-mother keeps her son, the future king of france under her thumb and that's that. don't not like her too much cause nothing is ever going to happen to her in this story. and it is definitely not cinderella. not only is there no happy ending, but the ending doesn't even make sense!basically joan is torn down by her countrymen, her enemies, and herself in the end. built-up and then torn-down. she's their hero one minute and then she's just a heathen the next minute.there is a graphic murder-rape scene right from the start that makes the movie a little hard to take. i have a bad opinion of movies that have rape scenes, especially when you aren't sure why they have them. it's a little too much of a sex scene for me. and if they want a sex scene they should just have a sex scene.it really isn't a horrible movie. it just had some big problems. if i had it to do over again i would have still watch it. it does have something to offer. but i still wouldn't have liked the movie overall.be sure to check out my other reviews.thanks.", "in my opinion, it is a blessing to have a writer/director such as luc besson in the industry. this movie, \"the messenger joan of arc,\" is simply one of my favorites, with great performances from milla jovovich (one of my favorite actresses and i'm still doubting whether i spelled the name correctly or not!) i feel this is excellent, as well as educational, for i never would have known as much as i know about joan of arc if i had not watched this film. i can't wait for luc to come out with some more movies that i just may be able to catch in theaters! thanks for reading my response and have a great year.", "on the pure basis of \"was i entertained?\" i have to say i was. the movie was a decent watch that kept me interested. on that level the messenger is a good movie. the visual aspects along with the majority of the cast certainly helped this along. so it wasn't a horrible film. taken as a story simply and not historical epic, it's fine.on the other hand, history it certainly is not. i apologize to all who take the \"we just can't know\" stance, but yeah, we can know a lot more than one might think. there are records, evidence, artifacts, and documents that when combined and analyzed as a whole can provide us with a relatively accurate idea of jeanne d'arc's life and times.for story purposes, portraying jeanne as a borderline psychotic is a good move. it adds some element of tension to the character and the events that happen around her. to say that it presents a historically accurate picture is pure balderdash. jeanne was far more involved than just a visionary battle-maven.i write this all to simply say, those who say this is a horrible movie are being far too critical. and those who say it's a great historical epic are engaged in some wishful thinking. it's a good movie but not good history.", "this is, perhaps, the worst telling of the life of the joan of arc to ever be placed on celluloid. what makes this such a bad film?for starters, milla jovovich's portrayal of the joan of arc herself is much more if a caricature than anything else, and a purely annoying caricature at that. she plays the role with a completely one-dimensional fanatical gusto that is sometimes comical, but is more often grating.second is the direction and the screenplay. the first few minutes start off looking like something that would not be out of place in \"the sound of music\". then the graphic violence comes in, and then there is the very out-of-place moments of comic relief, and so on and so on. this film jumps between these three categories and more so unevenly that it feels as if it has no direction at all.and the comic relief mentioned above? i found the scene (near the beginning) where a woman is killed and then raped to be disgusting enough, but the way that it was played for laughs was tasteless beyond words. i'm no prude (i actually did find some redeeming values in \"salo\", actually), but that scene was just plain sick.all in all, this was one of the rare moments when i was watching a movie that i actually started to find myself growing increasingly impatient to see the conclusion. i actually started to want to see joan of arc being burned at the stake, because that would mark the end of the movie, and my suffering through this terrible piece of cinema would finally be finished.if you must see a joan of arc movie, see carl dreyer's silent masterpiece \"the passion of the joan of arc\", and accept no substitute. but avoid this version at all costs.", "when god (dustin hoffman)

british from 15th century france to establish charles the vii as king of france. in the process she also avenges her sister's rape and death at the hands of a british soldier. joan's possible self doubt and confusion is well portrayed by jovanovich.the good news is that there is no gratuitous nudity.the bad news is that there is much blood and gore - but i have seen worse (such as saving

be a man so she can fight in war. joan believes that she is being driven by god, and the film portrays her devout religious visions that enable her to want to fight the english. as the famous story goes, it is not a very happy ending for joan. this is a pretty good film, although it is slow in places and a lot of the religious visions could have been edited out, and this would not have subtracted from the story at all. the cinematography was also done well, and the different camera angles and general use of the camera helped to understand joan and her feelings. it's a good historical picture, but it is a long film to sit through, and it could have been edited further.", "one of the few times i generally was embarrassed to actually be in a theater. the story of joan of arc generally appealed to me but the direction this movie took did not and this mainly due to the fact the storytelling itself is flawed. milla jovovich's character \"joan\" describes the screenplay of the film to a letter, dazed and confused throughout. it interesting though how the story also tries to balance itself by introducing new ideas on what is and is not divine and even this element was clumsily and randomly introduce as plot elements, from faye dunaway's character fumbling with the vile of \"blood\" to joan herself seeing \"visions\" dustin hoffman's performance was fair but totally unnecessary the film could have limped on without him. joan rationalizing with herself would have been much more believable then this. as far as the cinematography goes it's quite nice, brilliant in fact along with the score. i was really was expecting much more from this film and besson which usually makes excellent work, unfortunately this is a dud.", "if you really want to know the story of jeanne d'arc, you should better take a book... then you will learn that we do not know a lot of things about her. but the luc besson's movie never aimed to tell the << true >> story, but a story, it is very different. if you can't understand it, so you don't even understand what is cinema.as a movie, i find it great. the story is moving in a different way. and the violence is necessary. the story to be told is violent, but i do not think the entire movie is violent because the end of film annihilates this violence. the last confession is there to tell us that everybody can be blind when one has a cause to defend, this is a message of tolerance to the people who act badly, one has to understand them and know that they suffer too.", "i couldn't wait to see her get burned at the stake at the end of the movie. knowing this would eventually happen was the only thing keeping me from walking out. the casting was awful and the direction was uneven. do yourself a favor and dont waste your life watching this garbage.", "this is the worst version of joan of arc i've ever seen - and i think i've seen them all. if you know the real history of joan of arc, you'll be very disappointed.instead of portraying joan as a sane, sensible, highly intelligent young woman who rationally planned and led a series of brilliant military campaigns lasting multiple days to save france from the english (her profile according to historical records), this film portrays her as a mentally delusional girl suffering from weird hallucinations and irritating emotional outbursts with totally irrational, impulsive military leadership. since quite the opposite was true according to historical facts as we know them and i don't enjoy watching a raving, irrational female take over leadership from calm, rational people, this is a film i would not bother to see again.the acting was mostly well done (her part was often overdone) and the special effects were on par. that said, i don't think it's a film worth watching, especially if you hope to see a genuine heroine.it's a shame they couldn't have portrayed joan as the intelligent, rational person history records her as being...one who answered so ably in the heresy trials that they couldn't find any fault with what she said. a better version of this story would be the one with leelee sobieski, also circa 1999.", "what a powerful movie , milla jovovitch is incredible in this giving the performance of a lifetime as joan of arc , this movie impacted me in a way i have never known before .", "read all of my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com what happens when you take a talented french director, his model cum singer cum actress wife, one of the greatest actors of the 70's and makes a movie about one of the most renowned saints of france? you get a giant mess is what. the messenger: the story of joan of arc is loaded with lots of talented people, is filmed gorgeously and is mostly a lousy, muddled film.the story of joan of arc (or jeanne d'arc as they call her in france) is well known just about everywhere. joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in france during the hundred years war with england. she begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is god's messenger to rid her country of the bloody english. somehow she convinces charles, the dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm orleans. using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. the dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about joan. she leads an unsuccessful siege on paris is given over to the english, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the catholic church. the messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.luc besson is a talented director filming such classics as le femme nikita and the professional. his talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. he doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. in parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.milla jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the resident evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. it is not a nuanced performance. for the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.the battle or orleans is tame at best. there are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. we are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. later the storming of paris is so humorous it is sad. joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the paris gates. these soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a monty python sketch than a serious film about war.beyond the visual elements the only saving grace is dustin hoffman's performance as the grand inquisitor or conscience. it is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. he spends his time questioning joan's own sanity. could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? good questions in the history of the real joan of arc, but they seem out of place here. nowhere in the film are we led to believe joan is nothing but the real thing. why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. the film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in joan's purpose and vision. or questioning her visions from the beginning, a re-visioning of the myth could be very interesting. instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.what we get in this portrayal of joan of arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from dustin hoffman. try renting one of luc besson's earlier films and pick up anything from hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.", "i won't lie, the first time i saw this movie, i thought it was a mess. but i wanted to watch it again. i thought dustin hoffman's role was totally bizarre.over the years, i learned more about medieval warfare, the real story of joan of arc and, i hate to be honest, but after a few years, i came to really appreciate this movie. people often criticize how joan of arc was portrayed. after some life experience, let's be honest, this was probably an accurate portrayal. people claiming that god speaks to them likely are not sane in the head or normal. plus, she was a charismatic person that won the hearts of an entire nation and the soldiers. you don't do that by being boring. also, luc besson is french. i wouldn't put it past him to have some anecdotal accounts of what she may really have been like passed down through history. this portrayal likely may have been based on the more controversial accounts that hollywood and the church didn't like to acknowledge.milla jovovich claimed recently this movie is a cult hit. not really sure if it is or not, but i recommend it whenever possible. unfortunately, i don't think many people will get it. i was raised in the catholic church school system, so for me, this movie was absolutely outrageous when i first saw it, until, like i said, some more years of life experience and historical knowledge changed my mind about it. i'm sure the teachers and religious figures at school would not approve of this movie, but what do they know? most are sheltered, intellectually lacking, provincial types anyways.", "joan of arc as portrayed in the film seems to be a self-proclaimed messenger of god, over zealous in her beliefs. she came across as an obsessive, compulsive individual or one plagued with schizophrenia. the onscreen joan of arc didn't possess any kind of battle skills besides shrieking and egging people on to fight. the battle scenes are very small in scale and felt more like a skirmish between two warring towns rather than two countries. milla jovovich did a commendable job playing an unbalanced joan of arc. however, due to such extreme eccentricities, as an audience you never fall in love with the character or empathize with her, inspite of her tragic death. there lies the reason why the movie didn't do too well at the box office. but it's a movie worth watching once.", "i loved everything in this movie .. as i loved her and her great story and life ! great act ! how powerful and strong is she ! and inspiring ofc", "i watched this pile of rubbish during a period of a couple of months when i was on vacation, holed up with a friend and we would just rent a couple of movies most nights and 'review' them. he was initially very enthusiastic because it had several of his favourite actors in it. i think we managed to get through nearly an hour of it before the awful dialogue, ridiculously contrived situations, excruciating political correctness and general awfulness got the better of both of us and we reached for the remote, sparing ourselves whatever further horrors may have lurked in the latter portions of the movie. this is just overrated rubbish, with terrible lead acting, and an air of revisionist self-importance, and some plain silliness thrown in for good measure. i wish jay sherman had been around to review it. 3 out of 10.", "wow. this may have been the _most_ random movie i have ever seen. i have never watched a movie that made less sense. you are thrown headlong into a life that happens so insanely quickly that i cannot follow it, and i am not stupid. at first it seems that it is a statement on how religion is the only way, and that everyone should follow blindly. go watch dogma. (by the way, why doesn't she ever stop twiching????? ahhhh!", "i saw this yesterday on tape and i must say it was incredible. i thoroughly enjoyed the film, but if a person didn't adore braveheart then by no means is he going to like this one. this has almost everything braveheart had but although it won't reach the high step on which braveheart resides (and will reside), it sure is close. having seen milla jovovich in the fifth element, i never thought she could pull off a role like this but boy she did, and i was left wondering who could do it better than her! and i don't think anyone would have, because her acting was, simply said, superb! the way she played the character, the face expressions, the emotions, fear, passion, hatred, enthusiasm, awe, i sure owe her an apology.anyway, the scenery is fantastic, the other actors also did a great job, the fights were incredible (a less-gore version of saving private ryan combined with all the awe and emotions of braveheart). i bet it would have looked amazing at the cinema.i also liked the focus on the inner thoughts and visions of joan, e.g. when near the end of the movie she is left wondering if it was for god, or for her self she was making the war. the inner struggle within joan is amazing, the not-knowing-for-sure what she is doing and the i-am-waiting-for-a-sign-now attitude was a pleasant addition to the character's development, and boy was it worth it! also, concerning the character, i thought it was a great move in the beginning of the movie to delay the appearance of the adult joan (m.jovovich). shades here and there, a black cape on, to cover her by now mysterious face and accentuate the anxiety of the viewer to see what has become of the little girl joan.overall, although it hasn't made me weep like braveheart had, it still holds its ground steady, right below braveheart, and it would take a hell of a movie to pull this baby down from the 2nd place in epics. (hmmm...i haven't seen the patriot yet. who knows...)", "i am sorry to say that i would not recommend this film to anyone! few americans would tolerate a film about the life of a great president (say, george washington) who was portrayed as a closet transvestite who kept a heard of goats in the basement of the white house for his sexual pleasure. and yet, this is how saint joan of arc was portrayed in \"the messenger\" film -- someone who was a delusional, schizophrenic, egotistical, emotional, and narcissistic woman obsessed with revenge for the \"hypothetical murder\" of her older sister, an event which all historians agree did not take place. anyone desiring to learn about the real jehanne should read regine pernoud, especially her book \"joan of arc: by herself and her witnesses\", a masterpiece on the life of jehanne, la pucelle.", "anyone interested in history and the military weapons of war during the reign of charles vii,( john malkovich,\"johnny english\" 03 will enjoy this picture and the great acting he portrayed as king. the entire picture took years to make and the photography was outstanding and very realistic with blood and guts on the battle fields with armored wearing human beings slaughtering each other. faye dunaway (yolande d'aragone) \"the calling\" '02 performed her role as a very evil advisor to charles vii. i was taken by surprise to see dustin hoffman(the conscience)\"runaway jury'03\" playing this role, i immediately recognized his voice and was able to see his face with the long beard. this film keeps you on the edge of your seat and great credit must be given to milla javovich(joan of arc) \"you stupid men '02 who had to view horrible abuse as a young girl. view this film when you can, you won't be sorry!", "this is two and a half hours of my life i want back.milla jovovich is perhaps the most miscast actress ever. you can't believe for a second that her whiny, screeching, obnoxious joan of arc can inspire the french people. being forced to spend that much time with a main character who you can't like at all is a painful experience. the script was horrible, constantly setting up lines that were supposed to be \"inspiring\" but instead came across as contrived. various characters changed attitudes off screen leave the audience confused when they showed up again speaking a completely different position from the one they were behind not more than ten minutes ago. instead of explaining why they changed we are supposed to accept that they did since it moves the story forward. the script also constantly had the characters demonstrating political attitudes far more common to the 1990's than the 1430's leading to some very jarring situation.i got the impression that this movie was the result of a hollywood hit factory where they mix up all the required portions of a sure fire hit and cynically pass it off to people as entertainment.", "definitely one of the best films i've ever seen. hoffman's \"conscience\" just puts it together. does anyone has a right to kill even for a cause? what is right or wrong? how are we ever able to know it? is there god outside or inside us? this is not a war film. this is a film of people trying to understand life in their view. how can we say is it right or wrong view? i saw this movie in a film theatre and it was really hard to wait until it came out in video. i bought it right away. i just love all the actors and actresses, especially desmond harrington's jean d'aulon. he's one of the most sympathetic characters i've ever seen in the movies. milla is also really great in her role, she just suits it perfectly.all in all, i really liked this movie and i know i'll watch it over and over again.", "to me, this movie was like \"snow white.\" you know the story but you wouldn't mind watching twice or more. why? i think because the story is unreal but you can even put yourself in her shoes and be fantasied as her. well, i watched this movie through t.v. the story was basically same but the actor and actress were different (of course). but there was something different about this movie from the t.v. all the actors and actress had powerful tone in their voice. it felt real as the war and the crisis were happening right next you.", "this movie is not close to the actual events that took place 500 or so years ago. i have read all of joan's testimony (as recorded by the english) and nothing even remotely resembles the \"conscience\" scenes. not to mention that the movie is premised on a lie (by joan's own testimony, she had a happy childhood - her sister was not murdered and raped) and joan never described her visions as portrayed in the movie. if you skip the movie's version of her childhood and captivity, as well as all the \"vision\" scenes in between, then you'll have a better portrait of joan (albeit not a complete portrait). she was in fact impatient but also very caring (she wept for both the english and french dead and dying as well as praying with wounded soldiers regardless of their nationality).i think the topic the movie was trying to explore - is she divinely inspired or crazy - is a fair topic. there were those even within charles vii court who thought her \"mad\" and joan testified herself that many did not believe her. the problem is that the movie just made things up to highlight one point of view which in the end destroyed its credibility. the movie critics quite completely trashed this movie because of this and rightfully so.many will watch this movie and think this is based on historical facts which is very lamentable. joan is a remarkable figure in her own right and doesn't deserve any of these silly embellishments.", "i know that so many people out there just absolutely hated this film, but i enjoyed it through and through! i realize that it is nothing to be used as a historical reference, although neither was \"the last temptation of christ.\" it is a very creative interpretation and was brilliantly done, milla jovovich is an incredible actress, and played her role with perfection. i think what may have disturbed people was the way the religion, and the religious figures were portrayed. they were very disturbing. joan had what is called the sight. most of us have seen the sixth sense, and understand quite well what that entails. i, myself, have the gift of the sight, and see things that a lot of professionals cannot explain. i live a normal life, and have never taken any drugs, or even prescription drugs of that sort. joan of arc probably saw things and in her own interpretation became religious figures, such as angels, and gods. in a time where the catholic church was so powerful and dominating, it is no wonder that in this story joan saw and was moved by the things that she soon did. and it is no wonder she was burned at the stake. she had a gift that she could not fully use, or even understand because of the negative influence of the catholic church. i loved the film, and understood every motive behind the film.", "i was expecting an average movie, at least, but certainly i never expected such a waste of time. joan of arc is portrayed as a crazy woman, weak sometimes, violent others, but not as a strong woman as you would expect of someone who lived what she did. when you see so many good actors acting badly, you really have to think there is a problem in the direction of the film. the worst part of the film is milla, i just can't believe joan could have anything to do with her.", "the strong performances by milla jovovich and the others make this one a great movie about the legendary joan of arc. a well done piece to honor the memory of this exceptional woman (girl, as she died only 19 years old). two years after le cinquième élément, luc besson and milla jovovich did it again ;)", "pity poor mila jovovich. the idea was great. an epic retelling of the legend of joan of arc, feminist \"braveheart\" as seen through the eyes of france's answer to john woo. hey, i was on the edge of my seat to see it.then i saw it. ok, maybe i don't know that much about the real jeanne d'arc (director luc besson should know it better than me) but i was never aware that she was a raving lunatic who savored the taste of blood, breathed in heavy gusts, and couldn't say a complete sentence without pausing for dramatic effect. it's true, most foreign directors are great visionaries but when they are working with actors that don't speak the same language as them, something gets emotionally lost in the translation.that doesn't apply to the battle scenes though. after all, this is the director who gave us the fifth element and (more importantly) the professional. i can't say too much about them, however, i refuse to give away any of the shocks involved.this film was missing two things: 1) jean reno, luc besson's ever-present actor/sidekick (their relationship mirrors that of john woo and chow yun-fat), and 2) gary oldman. ok, i liked john malkovich's performance as the duphine of france but he seemed too 90s. in fact there were a few comic moments in this film that were so modern that i almost was expecting adam sandler to walk in as opera man and have him sing an announcement to the king of france.that leaves dustin hoffman for last...which is exactly what he is...last. trailers lead you to believe that hoffman is one of the stars. honestly he doesn't arrive until 120 minutes into this 155 minute film (much like brando in apocalypse now) and then he relegated to hiding under a hood and beard to urge joan back to reality just in time for her imminent execution. what a nice guy.i have a suggestion for great foreign directors who want to make american films: either hire another director like scorcese or coppola who knows how to pull a performance out of an actor and stick to doing the action scenes and designing the look of the film or hire actors that are so good they don't need direction. don't get me wrong luc, i love ya, but jovovich is a model...not an actress (and especially not a lead actress who can carry an epic of this magnitude).maybe its good they divorced. next!", "the best film of 1999, this movie deserve *****, the highest. luc besson took an actress, milla jovovich, made her do one of the best performances. people used to look at her body rather than her acting, but in this movie i was watching both. director besson made one of his best films since the professional (leon).breath taking shots by thierry abrogast, made this movie a work of extravagant beauty. the best joan of arc movie. this movie portrays a point of view that history doesn't look at, like what if jeanne d'arc (joan of arc) was crazy and was having these visions out of her imagination. in my movie list this movie is a classic, this movie is also in my top 25 favourite movies of all time.", "some people commenting on this movie obviously have little or no knowledge of history or art whatsoever. this film is by far the best portrayal of the era i have ever seen. the middle ages were full of blood, madness,fear, wars, death,disease, religious fanaticism, superstition, and hysteria. and this movie depicted it all so well and so stunningly, as if it were now. the settings, the costumes, the hairstyles, everything was superbly authentic. i can only imagine what it takes to make such a movie. it makes you feel as if those times come to life and this makes the movie unforgettable. of course if you prefer to watch rose-tinted movies about a history that never was and people who never were as they are depicted, it's up to you. this movie however is head and shoulders above many of the blockbusters we have got used to watching. it is pure art!", "after the first 15-20 minutes, i had to leave the theater. without a doubt, this is the worse film that is supposed to be based on a true story. obviously the screenwriter does not know the truth, nor the story and probably failed history in school. nothing, and i mean nothing in the first 15-20 minutes of this film was accurate, save that joan was female and lived in france.i could not tolerate having my intelligence insulted any longer, so i walked out. i just hope that others who have seen the film realize what they saw bared no resemblance to the true story of joan.", "about a year ago, the wife and i rented and watched the messenger. memory is a bit fuzzy, but i remember it being quite good. the most interesting thing is the role that this little girl \"mystic\" actually played in martialing french society. not knowing much about joan d'arc, i did not find the movie to be that controversial, and thought it was a quite visionary glimpse of life 500 years ago, as well as the inner workings of religious-inspiration swirled with ethnic/nationalism toward the end of the middle ages. evidently, quite a few adherents of saint joan found it to be literally heretical. the movie is probably not well suited for family viewing, nor for those who prefer a more sanitized view of french history or saint joan. but it is quite entertaining and compelling if you have some tolerance for uncompromising, sometimes even brutal images of the past.", "this film is ludicrous racist rubbish, besson should be criticised widely for producing such a surreal diatribe, that ignores the history to the power struggle between france and england instead concentrates on overly emotional story of one person who was more betrayed by charles the vii than her enemy england.chilish portrayal of demonic english and ever so twee french happy go lucky peasants is sickening twaddle and real you would expect more of a so call great director.don't humour him by watching this.avoid as historically incorrect as jfk.", "when our entire high school went to see ingrid bergman's joan of arc, we were led to believe that the film told the story as it really happened. now, students might believe the same about the messenger. too bad. this is an awful film, much shouting about nothing and poorly directed. no wonder dustin hoffman is hidden in the shadows and faye dunnaway smirks the entire time.", "john malkovich. faye dunaway. dustin hoffman. what an incredible star cast! i will see any movie with those grandmasters in acting. milla jovovich (the director's wife in real life) plays a part that was written for her. she is the perfect joan of arc. i really can believe in her.and with all these great actors, who all perform at their best we add the maestro director luc besson to the mix. i think \"joan of arc\" is his ultimate best work, next to \"leon\", which i saw back to back recently without realizing at first that they were both written and produced and directed by this french virtuoso director called luc besson, who also produced \"taken\" and the \"transporter\". all these movies burst to life with non stop action from beginning to end.\"joan of arc\" is a story about a girl (milla jovovich) in the dark ages who got a lucid vision in which she is ordered by god to fight for her king (john malkovich). will she succeed in her quest ordained by god?\"joan of arc\" tells the standard story that any movie does about knights and kings, but i havent ever seen the dark ages being portrayed so incredibly glorious and bloody simultaneously. what a shattering tragedy too. no happy end whatsoever, this legendary story ends in a truly vicious way. the film starts out spectacularly gloriously during the first 2 hours. the last half hour ends with heinous crimes and shocking defeat. but hey, it is true history which is being portrayed here. and history does not care about box office hollywood happy endings.if you are a sucker for milla jovovich (resident evil) then you will love this movie. but you are gonna have to suck mud or to put it more politely: you have to live with a not happy ending. so beware, but if you can stand a shattering defeat at the end, then this will be one of the greatest knights movies you have ever seen!!!", "luc besson has always provided material worth watching. this time he gives his art a more psychological angle, with audience left in practical aimless controversy. this is a film, like 'the fountain' or 'jacob's ladder', which, everyone who has seen its entirety, has something different to say about it. how do we depict historical figures anymore? should it be so constricted as a high school history book? with hardly any identity whatsoever? besson has definitely crafted quite a piece, in this. if you have previously seen any of the french guy's previous work, you would be able to pinpoint who exactly was behind the scene's, and what makes such cinematography shine. he used milla jojovich again, and must have originally appreciated her performance in 'the fifth element'. this time though, she is not a divine prophesied being, beforehand. but with the tables turned, someone talked about, after their monumental behavior within incidents. you don't exactly know what to think, but have respect for such a person with so much love and drive for france, that they are willing to give up their life for such a piece of land. and accordingly, wound up doing so. it was kind of left with the message, that you never really know what goes on inside a historical figure. only that, like all of us, there are constantly on a premise in which to work things out within themselves.", "this is simply one of the most awful films i have ever seen, alongside armageddon. beyond \"hammy\" performances, totally unbelievable, yet brilliantly shot. no fault of the director but the writing is awful. as always malcovich is class but milla is uniquely over dramatic and totally unbelievable. ok, i'm english so you would expect some bias but save yourselves 151 minutes of this! trust me.", "it was long time ago (about 3 or 2 months ago), when i wrote my emotional resume about movie. i was in hope that many people slowly will understand meaning of besson's version and in the same way will understand how and why besson makes movies. but it's seems so that us mainstream movie making style makes most people blind to other possibilities and visions. yes, it's good to be wealthy and live comfortably, but it's best to be a human being. why i'm saying this? because most of you have a imagination of joan as true, brave, clear-in-mind, good looking 17 years old girl, who saved france. yes, but it's just a imagination. no one can know how she actually was. and remember this - it's not jesus christ or someone else, who's character and outer appearance is created by our minds, if we honest. she was a real person, real girl with her fears (maybe you will say that she didn't have them at all?), doubts, weaknesses (everyone is weak in some kind) and great skills. besson simply makes his own version about her, but still let door be open. you don't like it? you maybe even don't like that we can't know these historical persons? that we can't know what really happened that time? it's annoying? yes it is. but better annoying true than sometimes stupid and sweet lies. and at the end i maybe will repeat myself: besson makes movies about humans, not dolls. his characters - we can cry on them, that they are doing wrong, can suffer with them, feel sad about them, we can do everything, except denying them. p.s. mostly besson don't makes movies only for money, that's sure. in us, biggest part of movie industry do. that's sad.", "at first, i think this movie is too long. it should have been 30 minutes shorter. second, the acting is actually bad. even dustin hoffman and john malkovich are pretty bad. i really love the action scenes. they are very well crafted. that's actually the only thing that was good about this movie. luc besson disappoints me. * out of ****", "we all like a good biopic, right? not when it comes out all screwy, like \"the messenger: the story of joan of arc\" does. maybe it's the (almost) laughable anachronisms. for example, a soldier sarcastically says \"jesus christ\"; anyone who understands the evolution of english knows that people didn't use \"jesus christ\" as an expletive in medieval times. later on, after joan (milla jovovich) has been injured, someone says \"she's nuts.\" come on, people!!!!! in the 1400s, \"nuts\" was not a synonym for \"crazy\"! because of these misplaced comments - not to mention other things - the acting comes out a lot weaker than it should, given the supporting cast (dustin hoffman, faye dunaway, john malkovich).all in all, you feel like your brain just got warped after watching this movie. probably the worst kind of movie is one that had really good intentions but got ruined through incompetence; this is definitely one such movie. if nothing else, it's good to know that this didn't ruin everyone's careers. the cast members have since made up for it. but considering that luc besson has made such good movies as \"the professional\" and \"the fifth element\", don't waste your time on this.", "i think milla jovovich did a great job in this movie, just rent it alright its

movie, just rent it alright its great, also it also makes you think: whats your purpose in life??", "just around the time this movie was made, a miniseries about the same subject was also made. if you want to find out about joan of arc, watch the miniseries which is vastly superior to this failed attempt to tell a potentially very interesting story. whereas the miniseries gave a very detailed look at the story of joan of arc, and took a lot of time to develop the characters, their backgrounds and their motives, this movie is a slow and boring mess.despite its 2.5 hour plus running time, very little happens. we are shown just a couple of events from joan's life, and none of the secondary characters are developed at all. the historical context and politics are also kept to a minimum. instead, the movie spends a lot of time on joan, and whether she was divinely inspired or just plain crazy. granted, that's an interesting issues, and it might have worked if joan had either been played by a good actress, or if the dialogs had been good. unfortunately,neither of these conditions apply. milla jovovich just doesn't have the acting talent to pull of a convincing performance. she makes joan look like an utterly unsympathetic, crazy and frightened religious fanatic. how somebody like this could have ever inspired anybody is beyond me, you're much more likely to feel sorry for her.the dialog and the supporting cast don't help either. dustin hoffman does a fine job, but john malkovich is totally wasted here, and the other actors are generally very unconvincing. the dialog is horrible as well: the parts that are intended seriously are so heavy-handed and cliché that they become unintentionally funny, whereas there are also some light-hearted parts that feel totally inappropriate.given the directory's experience with action movies, it's surprising that he doesn't even get the action sequences right. the action is fairly gory, but it lacks any kind of tension or coherence, and is often fairly silly, to the point where the characters start vivid discussions in the middle of the battle, standing with their backs towards the enemy. right.\"the messenger\" is a completely wasted attempt at telling the story of one of the most fascinating women in history. the story, intrigue and secondary characters are dumbed down to a point that is almost becomes silly, the pace is dreadfully slow, the action is dull, the dialog and acting are very unconvincing, and milla jovovich completely fails to make an interesting or even likable character out of joan.*1/2 out of *****", "the messenger (the story of joan of arc) the messenger speaks truth unlike the majority of films we are being confronted with as a result of the factory-like production of moving pictures. joan as a youngster hears voices, which are obviously the voices we can all hear if we really listen. if you don't believe in that statement don't read any further. in her youthful naivete she equates those voices that understandably seem supernatural in the world she lived in and we now live in. when most people cast those voices away, her voices take the forefront in her life through a set of difficult circumstances. to me films like fight club and the thin red line deal with exactly the same issue  exactly. being in touch with these inner `messages' gives her access to truth as best as a human will ever know it. she is inherently a good person just as we all are when we're born. with her worldly belief in the structures and reality that the church represents  she has made an assumption that her voices are truly god's will. her obvious conviction in her inner `messages' are so convincing and intoxicating to everyone that is in her presence, even her perceived enemies, that `joan the peasant girl' has the capability to lead an entire army (not that she cares about that status beyond a vehicle for truth). people sense that this person has no hidden agendas or ties with traditional means of gaining power or status or money  she fights for what she believes in  and its overcoming. it's an absolutely beautiful film and a work of art from luc besson and his team, not in the spirit of they'll do anything to put a different spin on joan but to give a genuine perspective that is unique  even without knowing every little detail on joan of arc the film speaks truth. they are to be commended. i simply couldn't hold back my tears at certain points of the film. i would like to see this film be embraced by the money giving mass audiences but i'm afraid that won't happen  again not unlike fight club or the thin red line. but for me if there were not films like the ones i've mentioned then the world would be a darker lonelier place to live in.", "not long before i saw this film, i had read vita sackville-west's excellent biography of st joan. the work she put into the research to find the actual facts regarding the patron saint of those who fight for their country won my admiration.i was therefore bitterly disappointed with this film which monkeyed around with the known facts to sex things up a bit. that's just cynical. firstly, why have a glamourpuss of a joan of arc? sadly, the only known contemporary portrait of st joan is lost. however, all contemporary accounts describe her as short of stature and plain(ish).as others have pointed out, there is no evidence that any member of her family was killed or raped by marauders. therefore the film's motivation of st joan on a crusade of revenge is utter drivel.i am afraid that the howling mad scotsman with the red beard who was fighting on the side of the english was something of a renegade: any scots at the siege of orleans (and there were some there) fought for the french. (the painter of the one lost painting of st joan mentioned above was a scot.)yes, it is certainly true that the french had longbows as well as arblasts and handguns; but why do i get the impression

minute. his film, the messenger, may yet be the most psychologically accurate account of the story of jeanne d'arc. besson attempts to rationalise her actions and with stunning reality.behind her armour, besson speculates that jeanne d'arc is simply another victim of war, so tramatised that her questionable sanity led her country to victory, at least for a while. he also went on and modelled the other characters as people who care about nothing but themselves, not common even by to-day's standards.beyond its value as a psycho-drama, however, the film is simply supported by a series of fight scenes with lots of armour, impressive siege weapons, and blood and gore. besson focused too much into jeanne's psyche that there was not enough time for the characters to develop, including jeanne herself. as a result, the film seems empty, the plot linear, and the acting mechanical.the way besson divided the film, i often could not help myself but to associate it with george orwell's novel \"1984.\" there are striking similarities between the two work, both in structure and context which makes me wonder if this is where he drew his inspiration.despite the use modernised language (that is, fudge, sheet, etc.,) the messenger is reasonable entertainment for those who thrives on realism, but are not too interested in any in-depth post-movie discussion."]}

(note, i'm not writing nazis. these were germans of that era). having been thought of like the scum of the earth, these men proved that given the opportunity they can be incomparable in the air battles while many english pilots weren't even combat ready. the movie plays itself a bit slowly, cgi isn't the best you can get these days, there are many fictional subplots interwoven by the ones responsible for the screenplay, also there are some emblems missing from the planes, most notably the polish checkered logo and donald duck from zumbach's (rheon's) plane. despite those slight omissions, and some fictitious plots it is quite enjoyable. it takes itself seriously, without pompous heroism nor wallows in martyrdom. it is a well organized, quite serious flick that makes you think. most people didn't realize it at the time but poland lost due to the fact that before the war there were only 20 years of freedom, hence the military was not ready to deal with germans' forces. there were atrocities committed all over poland, but some people were able to flee and add to the allied effort, it's great that they're getting the recognition they had deserved. i highly recommend it to anyone, even though it might be a bit uncomfortable for some british to watch.", "it's 1940 and france is about to fall. polish fighter pilot jan zumbach (iwan rheon) steals a plane and escapes to england. he joins a group of international fliers eager to fight the nazis and resists being relegated to the bombers. witold urbanowicz is one of the first poles allowed to fly a fighter plane. eventually, they are allowed to form the legendary no. 303 squadron. phyllis lambert works in the raf war room.this starts out well. the story of the polish fliers is compelling. not everything is the best. the cgi aerial dogfights are not the highest quality. there are some tangential plot elements that muddle the story. it's not unexpected to have a racist british officer in this movie but it pushes every villainy onto him by making him a sexual harasser. he goes off the deep end unnecessarily. the short flashbacks are fine to lay down the groundwork for their motivations but they need to be longer to fill out their stories. as a traditional war movie, this is fine but nothing special.", "after eighty years of silence from hollywood around the most inspiring epic story of wwii, suddenly in 2018 two movies were released about the polish 303 squadron based at raf northolt for the battle of britain. this little known story that surely deserves to be told, is based on the real story of the polish government moving itself and their military to britain after poland was invaded by the germans in the west and the russians in the east. but does mission of honor do this story justice? with tarty wafs, bullying snobbish raf pilots, and dispicable raf officers, the inspirational core of the story seems to get lost in a series of unfortunate events, which should be that these highly skilled pilots decimated the luftwaffe, outshone the british pilots, flew day and night in all weather daringly downing double the number of the planes that the british downed, and turned the tide of the war by preventing hitler from invading britain, and therefore making it possible for the americans to have bases there. perhaps this story has not been told in war movies because the west is ashamed of the ending. while the allies won the war, poland became a satellite of the soviet union, and the polish military were not allowed to be a part of the victory parade because it would have offended stalin. this movie is unsurprisingly anti-british in its bias, but does not allude to how the polish pilots were appreciated by the common people of britain as their exploits were heralded on the radio and pathe news.", "thank god the polish fighter pilots were there to help us win the war, don't know if britain would have survived without the 303 squadron. they stopped the nazis invading us!its amazing how a handful of pilots turned the war.", "where to begin? this film is disappointing on so many levels.to begin with the script must have been written by a teenager, or at best a millennial with no appreciation for how people spoke on the 1940s. time and again words were used that brought me up with a bump and a cringe. \"thanks for the invite\" is a horrible late 20th century replacement for \"thanks for the invitation\". it just grates. and no one ever said \"roger that\" in that era. there are other examples but i gave up on hoping for script authenticity after a short while.but the absolute worst of this film was the total ignorance of aerial combat in the second world war. fighter pilots never ever flew straight and level for more that 5 seconds at a time, and they were constantly swivelling their heads to scan the sky for the enemy. so to see hurricanes and me109s flying in a straight line with the pilots staring fixedly ahead like sunday day-trippers in the middle lane of an empty motorway was risible in the extreme.the combat scenes were created in cgi by kids who, again, have no clue as to how it actually took place. the hurricane couldn't out-fly the me109. the latter could out-climb even the more agile spitfire, and though it couldn't out-turn a spitfire it certainly could the hurricane. so we were treated to scenes of 109s flying straight and level while hurricanes picked them off and blew them out of the sky. that just didn't happen. actually, the cgi fighter sequences in star wars were more akin to how it was, not the pedestrian sequences we were obliged to watch.in fact anyone who has read anything about the battle of britain knows that the hurricane was always sent to engage the slow-moving bombers. the german fighters that we're sent to protect them were taken on by the spitfires. the high kill score for hurricane squadrons was for bombers; hugely important because it was the bombers that did the damage on the ground. but of course that doesn't chime with the desired picture of sky-jockeys in one-on-one combat.oh, and the skin of the hurricane was fabric not metal, so the sight of bullets spanging off the metal sides of these planes was completely incorrect. it's the spitfire that had an aluminium monocoque fuselage.and the women at the plotting table? the idea that one of them would countermand the instructions of the senior officer in charge of deploying the squadrons is ridiculous.this film was a juvenile attempt at heroic storytelling that dismally failed, and made a bit of a mockery of the real polish heroes of the raf. the storyline was weak, the dialogue written by people with a tin ear for the period, and combat sequences that would have been acceptable if someone on the team had done just one hour's research.and the final engagement between the hero's hurricane and the 109? i won't deliver a spoiler but it was absolutely ridiculous.for shame.", "as mentioned elsewhere, the poles deserve better than this - many of the cgi kills were highly improbable - tailplanes don't just blow up - there's no fuel down there.that said, it is worth a watch. a better film in this genre is dark blue world, but it revolves around czech pilots with real spitfires.....", "world war ii movies are perhaps my favorite genre and i've probably seen 85%+ of the wwii films produced over the years. while this film is not on the same level or even in the same league as 1969's battle of britain (and honestly that are no other battle of britain films extant that are in the same league as the 1969 battle of britain film), i did find hurricane (2018) to be very enjoyable. period war movies are so very difficult to make, but the filmmakers did an exceptional job recreating the authentic look and feel of 1940's england and the raf. you'll be very pleased to find that the story-line, though highly dramatized, does provide you, the viewer, with the proper historical perspective and background of world war ii's battle of britain, and the formation of the polish squadron 303. the acting overall is very competent, sadly though with the exception of the lead female actress, who i just did not fine to be such a good fit relative to the performance of other actors in the film, plus the oddity that her character really suffers from having bleached blonde hair and a plethora of dark brown roots, which is something (women dyeing hair) that wasn't socially acceptable in 1940's britain. the story line does , but only very slightly, suffer historically in the way it portrays british raf officers being hateful and antagonistic towards the polish volunteers. by all accounts the brits during this time were deeply grateful to the military help of each and every allied soldier, sailor or airman, if not for anything else than for britain being entirely on their own at that time while fighting the nazis. the aerial combat and dogfight scenes are mostly competently done in cgi, though could have been so much better had the cgi artists been aware that aircraft engines cause the airplanes vibrate and that it is impossible for a plane and pilot to fly in perfect formation without being tossed around by wind gusts regardless of altitude. the only other primary fault i would find with this film is the screenwriter's use of anachronistic dialogue, i.e. having a character state that a squadron is coming \"on-line\" or having a squadron leader during flight order his pilots to stay off \"com's\". neither of those modern day/internet age terms would have been used in the 1940's. otherwise, i was surprised to see some scenes showing the polish pilots appearing away from their airfield dressed in civilian clothes, as that is something that would have been so unlikely since wearing the uniform was akin to a badge of honor, while those of fighting age not wearing a uniform were very suspiciously as skulkers. except for those few flaws, hurricane is a very compelling film which justly shows the courage and determination of a group of polish pilots who had lost everything due to the nazi destruction and subjugation of their homeland, and who wanted desperately to make the german luftwaffe pay in blood for their barbarity.", "a great story of the heroism and skill shown by polish pilots deserves a much better telling. in fact it has already been done by channel four with their docudrama, \"bloody foreigners\" which tells the story more concisely in half the time, with personal recollection of some of the pilots themselves and dramatisation. hurricane is so low budget, in fact i suspect more of the budget was spent on sandwiches than the cgi. a lack of characterisation of the principal players and of the very, real hurdles put in front of talented but \"foreign\" pilots, make this a very lazy effort at best. the only upside, maybe, that the viewer who's interest in this story has been piqued, will probe further elsewhere and may, more fully, appreciate the sacrifice , talent and bravery of our erstwhile polish allies.", "watch this movie. the total budget was likely what was spent just for catering a 'skyscraper' movie i wasted a few hours watching. i am an aficionado of ww2, i can spot mistakes. and? the story of these brave men is not well known - a pity. there were several groups of pilots from several occupied countries who made it to britain and fought like lions. the poles, were brave - and nuts. some of the crazy scenes - are true (not a spoiler). the effects - yah, not up to hollywood top cgi, but, enjoy a true story with good acting,", "and someone rating this movie has commented that it is anti-british and shows the british in a bad light. i completely disagree. this movie does a fair job of showing what it's like when east europeans, in this case poles, are mixed with british blue-collar fighters. sometimes it just ain't pretty.", "i have been a researcher of the battle of britain all my life. i have dozens of books on the subject, from \"the narrow margin\", a tome which was used as the basis of the 1969 film, \"the battle of britain\", to many individual accounts, including ginger lacey, geoffrey wellum, tom neil, etc. it was the film which set my life in its direction, and i subsequently served 30 years in the raf, as aircrew.i also read the 303 squadron book. it was very clear from early on in this film that no one of importance in the making of it had ever read the book, nor had they watched the quintessential film of the era, \"the battle of britain\". had they done so, the pilots in the aerial sequences would not have appeared zombie-like, and the painfully slow manoeuvring of the computer-generated aircraft would have been rejected. i know they hadn't read the book, because if they had, they would surely have included an incident a few days after the squadron became operational, when their huge successes were initially disbelieved. a senior raf officer followed them up on a scramble to see for himself. his report went along the lines of, \"i don't know where they learned to fly like that, but it wasn't the raf....i've never seen flying or fighting like that in my life. in the future, if they claim 10 kills, you had better believe them.\" the script was too modern, with many millennial phrases, the character of phyllis (played by the lovely stefanie martini) insisted on strutting around in uniform with her hair down (never allowed, not even up to the present day), and appeared to be connected to some communications network far removed to the one she should have been monitoring in the plotting room. in reality, all she would have heard were simple instructions, like, \"303 sqn, square e17\", etc, and she would have moved the plot of the squadron to that square on the grid. this is a true story which should have been told much sooner than this, and it is a shame that they made such a mess of making the film. to anyone who wants to see a simple shoot-em-up, no doubt the film will suffice, but to anyone who cares about the past, it is a travesty.", "pretty good for being a new ww2 movie. the visual effects are 7/10", "there's definitely a story worth telling here, but the people behind this film have made an almighty hash of it.the script is awful, utterly awful - littered with modern euphemisms and liberally injected with clanking scenes of #metoo nonsense.the characters are paper thin, and mostly unlikable.the effects are poor and the choreography of the air battles is disjointed.if you want a good film about the battle of britain, go watch the 1969 film \"battle of britain\"", "i was just so disappointed with the dog fight scenes as the cgi's were like scenes from thunderbirds. if you can ignore this, it's a half decent film.", "one group of mostly unsung heroes are the international pilots who served with the british during wwii. in the case of \"hurricane\" most of these pilots are poles....polish pilots who escaped to britain after the fall of poland in 1939. and, in some ways this film is a nice tribute to them and their heroism. i say 'in some ways' because sometimes the film is very good....and sometimes the writing is pretty insufferable. too often, the men fight, argue and act in ways that the poles couldn't have acted....and it felt so much like it was controversy and the like just for the sake of controversy in the film. and, it's all way overly melodramatic and ham-fisted. the men deserved better than this.", "i recommend this movie not because it's a great film - it isn't - but because of its historical value. not much is remembered today about the raf's polish pilots, who were hugely responsible for neutralizing the luftwaffe and perhaps saving england from a nazi invasion.in any event, the film certainly does not deserve these low ratings! aside from the history, it's a well filmed, acted and entertaining movie.", "giving credit where it's due the use of polish in the film from actors who don't normally speak polish was worth a star.the rest was worth 0.pilots with their oxygen masks hanging off during combat so we can see who is who was ridiculous. speaking from the side of their mouths to issue instructions and congratulate each other was insulting to the audience and the pilots who flew during the battle of britain.the planes flew like something out of a star wars movie and they seemed to have endless ammunition. yes i know they only had one hurricane but the beauty of cgi is you can make it look real if you put some effort in. these were hurricane's not space ships.red tails did the same when they tried so badly to tell the story of brave black us airmen. that was an insult to brave men and this was as well.the story of one of the best squadrons during the bob was boring and the love story aspect even worse. even casting ramsay bolton could not make it interesting. the british film battle of britain told the story of the pilots and ground personnel wonderfully. they even acknowledged the many non british pilots who fought and died with a particular emphasis on polish pilots.don't waste any time on this tripe watch bob instead and see how to make a proper film.", "yes it's not perfect, but it's a great story of bravery, well told and exciting throughout.", "is it a brexit thing or just anti british in general?", "my landlord who owned a house at the end of one of the runways at heathrow was one of these pilots. he was a nice guy who loved planes and was quite similar in temperament to my next door neighbour who was an english spitfire pilot. so i can't see the need for the brit bashing which was the core of this film. there have been other black and white films that highlighted the contribution of the polish pilots in a much more upbeat fashion than this one, like \"reach for the sky\". we won the war together and that should not be forgotten. so no more of this brit bashing please from people who have no idea how the people of those days used to behave. everyone was much more positive and chirpy back then even though they went through horrors while today everyone has it easy and are moaning and groaning about how hard done by they are as shown in the film.", "our brave polish heroes fight a long battle against english intransigence and hostility in an allegory of the horrors of brexit, truly making this a movie of our times. while stylistically identical to star wars in terms of action, we are nevertheless rebooted in a strange dr who parallel world of only stiff, straight white people, dramatically reminding us that without people of colour and gender non-conformity society slides to fascist and imperialistic tendencies. the poles down to earth charm and obvious virility wins the hearts of the working class feminists struggling with authoritarian and oafish masculinity. the villainous english painfully learn that a closed border is a closed mind, and no amount of strafing immigrants with their war machine will stop hope.", "i was looking forward to watching this movie, but quickly disappointed with the really low budget special effects. i mean really low budget. it's not something i would watch again. the 1960s movie battle of britain has better effects.", "in 1940 the polish ambassador to the usa cut the ribbon on the pulaski skyway between newark and nyc. in 1941 when i was six years old, i met him and his wife a former follies girl, as was my mother, living in a basement apartment next to the 3rd ave el. i met their 2 sons one of whom was a pilot who flew american warplanes in the pacific. he sent me pictures of p-51s. unfortunately he was killed fighting the japs.in america polish people were well regarded, and my best mate in high school was polish, and ended up being my room mate as a college freshman.i did not know the 303 story till i watched download of this story. poorly written but well acted. maybe the brits remembered from history class that pulaski helped general washington's troops fight the brits in the revolutionary war and still considered america a colony, and poland a throwaway?brave polish service in ww2 needed to be told even if poorly written and directed.", "there is something about the british taking a good story and making it stiff and boring. this is one of those. wish it was better.", "i think if the budget had of been bigger it would of been more cohesive. it was pretty good though hence the 6. have watched it a couple times", "i was really looking forward to this film. however, it is just another film that portrays the british as bullies, our women as slags and our war effort as zero. this time, no disrespect to the polish pilots that did fight in ww2 with the raf, but the media are saying the polish won the battle of britain in the second world war. the cgi is poor. i'm not even sure why they named the film \"hurricane\". i definitely would not recommend this rubbish (unless you're polish).", "i read before could do with a better money spent on it but all in all movie is good and enjoyable", "many people will not be aware of the contribution made by foreign personnel to the battle of britain effort - but this film goes some way towards redressing that balance. the polish crews fought with distinction, courage and skill, as did those from other allied countries in occupied europe, the british empire and the usa.this film tries hard but is let down by some technical and historical innacuracies and second division cgi but is nevertheless enjoyable to watch. it does feel more like an episode of \"foyle's war \" than the classic \"the battle of britain\" but it is still watchable and credible and shows the stress and fatigue that the pilots lived with as their duties pushed them to the limits of their endurance. some of the plot does appear to have been borrowed from guy hamilton's 1969 classic film, but then death, destruction and hard partying would have been recurring themes.basically, if you don't expect too much then you won't be disappointed.lastly, i take issue with the idiotic plot summary that described the hurricane as obsolete (a correction has been submitted to imdb). the hurricane was a modern, capable, rugged and reliable aeroplane that was the mainstay of raf fighter command during the battle. hurricanes destroyed more luftwaffe aeroplanes than all the other allied forces combined - including the spitfire which seems to get all the glory.", "this movie is borderline codswallop. such was its desperation to portray the british as arrogant ingrates, it almost disappeared up its own jacksey. a much needed opportunity to tell the story of ww2 polish raf pilots was wasted in my view.", "important storyline about the contribution of polish aircrew to raf success added to the usual elements of any film about aircrew in ww2. this is watchable, with some action, and the ending worked for me and i am left with much respect for the poles then and now.however, while i could believe 'section officer maggie harvey' in my favourite film i had a little difficulty with 'phyllis lambert' in this one - she seemed too modern in her behaviour for me.the cgi isn't that bad. for anyone who thinks so, watch sky captain and the world of tomorrow!", "this movie - which is made in england - shows the story of polish fighter pilots who went to fly for the 303 raf squadron.i found the movie an attractive watch. it also shows historically relevant info about how the english army already in its early days of ww2 - during the so-called \"battle of britain\" - made use of foreign soldiers. and especially the polish pilots that together constituted the 303 raf squadron were the most effective of the complete raf.this movie also shows the arrogance of the english pilots in having difficulty accepting polish pilots in the raf.and not only that, but also the heartless behavior of the english population, whom at the end of the war made all foreign pilots leave england and repatriate to their \"home country\". pilots that fought to keep england from being taken by nazi germany were thereby 'thanked' by the english by having those same pilots sent to stalin's occupied territory where many were arrested and even sentenced to death.i score this movie 6.8/10, thereby making a 7-star imdb rating. i am of the opinion that this movie is too underrated with its current imdb rating of 5.9.as a final note, i want to say that i think that the movie had better be named \"raf squadron 303\". i think that better describes the load of the movie and also gives respect to the polish pilots that flew as pilot in that squadron.", "pretty bad. whoever made this movie has obviously never served in the r.a.f. stocks of ammunition in 1940 were very low and fighter pilots were instructed to think s.o.b. (i.e. short bursts) to curtail wastage. the movie 'pilots' of this movie would have been out of ammunition so quickly they would have been shot down in no time.there is nothing new in this movie that hasn't already been said and portrayed better in movies such as \"the battle of britain\", \"reach for the sky\", and others. that the polish pilots fought with courage during the battle of britain has never been in dispute, but no more than the courage of pilots of other nations. to imply that the poles alone saved britain is ridiculous.that the union flag was shown flying upside down just about sums up this movie. it displays how little research has gone into it.the two stars i award to this movie is to acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of all piiols who fought in this world-changing battle, and only that. the rest of the movie warrants zero.", "i much enjoyed this wwii movie with good air combats. it's also a forgotten piece of history that the polish airmen contributed so much to the raf. it's a good movie for boys of any age, that woe men will also enjoy.", "urgent warning to all about to see \"hurricane\" at the cinema. don't waste money. basically the whole film is flawed, the cgi is brilliant and there are lots of kites i've never seen in a film before. i have almost no taste in films and i love hurricanes but this was unwatchable.the script was atrocious and builds around a love story between the polish pilots and english girls but there was absolutely no chemistry. i only realised that two of the main characters was supposed to be an item at the rolling of the credits.apparently 1946 - 3 years is 1940.junkers 88 carry fuel tanks in their rudder fins.the bf 108 was pulled back into use as a bf 109 right alongside actual bf-109 and cgi bf109. pointlessly.luftwaffe pilots flying straight and level while hurricanes sneak up behind them and ram them. twice in the film.a junkers 88 is shot down and the polish pilots goes to get a soulvineer, which consists of using a knife to cut a crudely drawn swastika on a piece of bed linen off the wing where the balkenkrutz should have been. and.... many many more....", "not sure if this was a major theatrically released picture, but it sure seems like it was. the performances were solid and the battle scenes realistic, or at least what i think of as realistic (since i never was in a ww2 dogfight). if you're into ww2, especially its air combat, then this is for you. not sure if they used cgi or real aircraft, but they looked quite realistic. this little known story of the battle of britain fully deserved this movie (author of \"renee: st. mary's virus).", "... which was the best film of the same genre that i can think of. and you may say it is not fair to compare this film to that one which had such a powerful cast. but don''t we always compare every film to the best film of its type that we have seen?this movie tells a story that is seldom recounted - that of the polish airmen who fought for the raf in britain during wwii, and then were unceremoniously booted from the country they defended, with many being repatriated to poland and being killed by stalin. \"we won the war but lost the peace\" quips one polish airman.the problem is, none of the characters are sufficiently developed. there is little meaningful dialogue, not among the british, poles, or canadians doing the fighting. and as a result of this lack of interaction between anybody i just didn't grow to care for these characters. there is an angry british incel among the officers, but his role seems to have no point. there is a blonde buxom british woman in the military who says \"she never says no\" and says \"who will i have to account to in regards to my summer of love?\". uh, maybe to all of your out of wedlock children that you'll be forced to give up for adoption due to the social mores of the time?? given that birth control was not all it was cracked up to be in 1940, i doubt that sexual libertines ran rampant as this film would have me believe.so maybe the aerial fight scenes were worthwhile? after all, it was the only redeeming quality of 2001's \"pearl harbor\". nah. somehow this film managed to make even air combat boring.so there were a few good scenes. one polish recruit is given an eye test and is told that he flunked. it turns out he was reading the \"made in britain\" line in tiny print at the bottom of the eye chart. one bilingual pole is given the task of translating a british officer's \"stiff upper lip\" speech and hilariously and deliberately mistranslates to his countrymen.the only thing i can really say that is positive about this film is that the cinematography was beautiful. but then that's true of most nature films.", "i have just watched this movie and loved it. i am familiar with the history of the kosciuszko squadron (a.k.a.squadron 303) and the movie is faithful to it. i was watching it through my polish eyes and i have not seen anything that would smell like hollywood and that would be absurd in terms of the behavior or words spoken by the poles in the movie. good job on reflecting the polish spirit of the fighters. highly recommended!", "it's like a half baked potato. making the polish fighter pilots a bunch of rustic peasants. terribly scripted screenplay, bad directing, and mediocre actors who played both polish or the british fighter pilots. sometimes you don't even know what the hell's going on. the actor who played the leading polish pilot was such an ugly dude. an pretty unlikable actor who played a disgusting role in \"game of thrones\". funny thing was when they partied or made love, the german foes seemed to be doing the same, no air raids or bombings. this is a lousy screenplay, lousy editing, lousy acting.", "this just doesn't really engage you. the action is dull, the special effects are ok, the movie generally is disjointed and unclear, the characters are not well rounded enough to care about that much. and its only because i read about 303 squadron that i knew what was going on. otherwise i think i think i would have given up. which is a shame as its a fascinating and tragic story.", "a budget movie that looks every minute of it. the battle scenes are computer generated, similar to the quality of a computer game you buy at a car boot sale on local street market with chinese titles. the story starts off with a polish pilot stealing an aircraft in occupied france and flies it to england totally undetected by the german forces and lands in england close to a hotel in which a number of other polish pilots are hiding in and not fighting with their own resistance army. once you accept the poor quality computer generated battle scenes, you are faced with a selection of bargain basement b actors and actresses. i would suggest the security services use this film as part of interrogation, i would confess to anything if i faced the prospect of having to sit through it again. avoid.", "acting wasnt great by everyone, but i found storyline interesting. i knew the polish pilots were involved in ww11 bit not to what extent. it held my attention right through.", "mostly entertaining and informative with pretty decent special effects for the airborne scenes. some of the pacing and editing was a little off and i did find the background music a little less background than i would like.", "b-class movie with a really bad script. the cgi of poor quality. i can't believe that iwan rheon decided to star in it.", "the exploits of 303 squadron raf during the battle of britain. the squadron consisted of polish pilots, many of whom were veterans of the air battles involved in germany's invasion of poland.broadly based on a true story, with 'broadly' being the key word. if you've watched battle of britain you'll know of the legendary polish squadron that generally didn't obey orders and was indisciplined but had tons of initiative and skill and ended up the most effective squadron of the battle of britain. this movie captures those aspects well, plus what the pilots saw and endured in poland, how they managed to escape to britain and their struggles to be allowed to fly fighters for the raf. also shows how badly they were treated after ww2, by the soviets when they returned home and by the british to appease stalin.the sheer courage, tenacity and impressiveness of their story pretty much writes the movie itself, all the writers and director had to do was keep the plot tight and accurate and the action sequences plausible. alas, this is where everything goes wrong. much poetic licence is taken with the story, to the point you have some marked departures from the truth and some eye-rollingly silly scenes. even if you don't know the true story certain things don't make sense, militarily or practically.plot is far from tight: heaps of sub-plots that add nothing and/or go nowhere.the action scenes are generally okay but also provide some of the more ridiculous, implausible moments. how zumbach gets two of his kills, in the movie, is all about style rather than substance.engagement is also rather limited. zumbach is the only character you really care about. the rest are very superficially drawn, if at all. means that when a pilot dies or is injured, you hardly know who they are, let alone care about them.overall, despite the clumsy plot and far-fetched combat sequences, the movie is watchable. the story of 303 squadron is and interesting one and one that needed to be told. plus, the dogfights are quite exciting.", "greetings again from the darkness. the true story of the polish fighter pilots who helped the royal air force (raf) win the battle of britain in wwii is certainly fascinating and deserves telling. however, the budget constraints are a hindrance to this production, and though the story gets told, it's missing the visual flair we've come to expect. it's the first screenplay from co-writers robert ryan and alastair galbraith, and together with director david blair, they all seem to understand the historical importance of the story and those involved.the film begins in 1940 german occupied france, and this is where we first see zumbach (played by iwan rheon), on his way to meet up with his fellow polish pilots in england. poland had only been a free standing country for about 20 years at this time, and these men were committed to salvaging their country ... even if this meant fighting with the raf against germany. initially the arrogance of british commanders borders on racism, as it's assumed the polish fighters don't compare to the elite royal air force pilots. once stationed in northolt under kentowski (milo gibson, mel's son), squadron 303 begins to take shape flying hurricanes, disproving most of the preconceptions of british brass and pilots; although their success does cause some jealousy in the ranks over the prowess of the polish pilots.the less than stellar cgi used for the dogfights is a bit distracting, especially since there is only minimal character development. polish fighter ace witold urbanowicz (played by dorcin morocinski) is idolized, but we learn very little about the man outside of flashbacks of his family in war torn poland. there is a budding romance with zumbach and phyllis lambert (stephanie martini), but quite a few assumptions must be made to take us to their final sequence. the character of ms. lambert is the standout female role here, and though she's given a few quality scenes, it's her shock of blonde hair that seems to stand out most.the film concludes in 1946 london with the victory parade for king george vi. despite polish pilots helping immensely in the raf victory in the battle of britain, no polish pilots marched with the allied forces. as a bitter zumbach states, \"we wouldn't want to offend %&*$ing stalin.\" squadron 303 was the highest scoring squadron of raf during the war, and it's unforgivable how the british viewed polish casualties as mere numbers, despite the dead being friends and countrymen to the polish pilots. this is overall a respectful approach to a key historical story, and one in which all polish people should take pride.", "so one of the two star reviews goes on about how the pilots are shown flying without their o2 masks. really? three quarters of war films depicting combat from the invention of the helmet in the bronze age to modern times show characters without helmets so the audience can tell the character's apart. really this is hardly a big deal, in fact it is done in private ryan and band of brothers.is this a truly great film, a \"10\" in terms of scope, dialogue, acting, cgi, etc? no. but come on it is a good film. none of the acting is bad, none of the dialogue will leave your head shaking. it is a compelling story, about a little known part of history, and well done considering the budget.well worth a watch", "i am sure like most movies made about ww2 there are many discrepancies in the plot, but one has to say that the true heroism of those brave men who left poland in the war to come and fight for us is truly admirable. it is such a pity that this movie fails to convey the magnitude of their contribution in an even handed way. the british pilots are shown as arrogant toffs who treated the poles like unintelligent rabble until they discovered they really were a fine bunch of airmen. the script unfortunately does not serve anyone very well and the storyline is vague at times. the aerial combat scenes are probably the best part of the movie and the characterisation is so underwritten that at times it was boring. having said all that, it was interesting to see a film that tried its best to convey an important part of english/polish ww2 history.", "as far as war movies go, this one is sub par.may sound like a rant, but terrible cgi, dog fights were totally unrealistic. acting is pretty poor, and the soundtrack is very dull. can tell it has been made on a budget.you can somewhat follow the story line, but the way it is scripted definitely needed some work. feels like it has been made by a college class on their first attempt at a movie.", "revelation, great movie, good actors, based on real story of real men fighting for their country and england and never giving up. very moving, very well done, certainly can recommend to everyone!", "i'm interested in all war movies and i'm always willing to give a wartime drama a fair go. however, unfortunately hurricane isn't very good. i struggled to give it a 6.there's no doubting the bravery of all who fought against evil forces in ww2. but many of the pieces brought to us about it either recently or in the past, just don't portray events well or credibly. i'm thinking: the battle of britain (1969) 6/10. a bridge too far (1977) 7/10. however, some stand out: saving private ryan (1998), or 1944 forced to fight (2015), both 10/10, or the forgotten battle (2020) 8/10, or the blisteringly good band of brothers (2001) 10/10, or equally brilliant generation war (2013) 10/10.the better films work because the stories are better, acted better, filmed better, more personal.hurricane doesn't work because it's trite. the stories are forced. the acting isn't great. somehow they've made a film which is un-engaging, despite what should be good action. the flying scenes aren't done very well - but the film relies on them, highlighting the weaknesses. direction and camera work is weak. i found that i just didn't care.on the plus side, hurricane looks spot on for 1940. some (very few) of the flying scenes are good. the ambience feels right.another thing hurricane does well is remind people that it took all of europe working together with many other countries to beat down the evil forces. it wasn't just england on its own. far from it.overall, i'm not recommending hurricane, and i've watched it twice now just to make sure!", "well worth watching. good performances but not great. good action but not great. unenjoyable movie.", "tedious and dissapointing. could have been so much more.", "who wrote the bit about the hurricane being obsolete? lulz they first flew less then two years before ww2 started, and were pretty much state-of-the-art for the year before the war.", "the actors were all fine, and that's about it as far as positives go. the editing made the movie very difficult to follow - i found myself constantly asking \"who is that guy again?\", \"whoa when did they get there?\", etc. just a muddled mess.the cg and air battle scenes were laughably bad, and therefore carried no tension or sense of importance. it looks like a cut scene from an early-2000's wwii flight sim game. just a waste of a good story, don't both.", "13 september 2018 film of choice at the plaza dorchester tonight - hurricane. a long overdue piece of film bringing not only the hurricane to the forefront but also the part a great number of polish pilots played in keeping the germans out of england. historically many pilots preferred the hurricane to the spitfire, with its better engines, providing superior speed and manoeuvrability and superior handling in the air, yet it's the spitfire that people bring to mind first. it's refreshing to sit and watch a film about a couple of underdogs, the hurricane and the polish pilots who flew them. it is also refreshing to watch a film just about the day to day life, the triumphs and the tragedies felt by everyone involved during what must have been the most horrific times. there was no reference to d-day, the battle of britain or any other specific events during the war, this film concentrated on individual battles between nationalities, sexes, ranks, and even friends. films like this portraying squadrons of planes fighting it out in the skies over ordinary people's heads, whether in england, france or even germany make me realise how lucky we are not to have lived through that. i don't know how our grandparents survived. i must say it wasn't the best film of flying sequences i've ever seen but somehow it didn't matter, as i found myself willing all these young men to get home safe. interesting to see milo gibson playing the canadian officer, looks just like his dad but maybe a bit better looking.", "for what the polish fliers accomplished during the battle for britain is a solid 9 or even a 10. for the way this movie portrayed their accomplishments it deserves a 1 or 2 at best. guess this averages out to a 5", "very sad to see something that could have been so good, done so badly. a story like this needed to be in the hands of a skilful team. they must have been busy elsewhere.", "a good story but portrayed in a woke hollywood style making more points about xenophobia and misogyny than it did about the story being told.", "went to see this movie last night.. loved it. i was not aware of the story of these fantastic heroes, (polish fighter pilots). the movie gives an excellent sense of the tension of war, the stress and sacrifice people went through. the story unfolds at a good pace, well worth a trip to see it.", "after all these years. i thought it was hollywood that won the war but it turns out it was the poles.anyone who has any knowledge of the history will need no convincing of the bravery and courage of all of those who fought in the conflict, including the poles. they definitely won't need this garbage.a second rate movie with third rate actors, a rubbish script and the worst cgi ever. the movie plays to some i'll placed belief of those making it that there's some wrong that needs to be out right and attempt to do so with some highly exaggerated stereotypes and atrocious acting.rubbish.", "when goering told hitler that he could bomb britain into submission, a few heroic badly outnumbered pilots stood between britain and defeat. this movie manages to make the british pilots look like a bunch of snobbish elitists and the polish pilots look like drunken louts with a perpetual chip on their shoulder who are otherwise superstar pilots. the plot revolves around polish pilots who escaped hitler's conquest of eastern europe and came to britain to fly against germany. we are told that poles would be great pilots if just given a chance, but were not given the chance because of prejudice. more likely, britain didn't have the aircraft. when they are finally given the chance, no one believes how good they are. this is a story that had to be told. it could have been told better.", "i don't ever go off reviews, what one finds awful, one might not. but this, oh boy this really is as bad as the majority reviews say it is. not even one bit is accurate to the timing it tries to portray and just by the first 5-10 minuets i was ashamed i even bothered.", "i'm a huge aviation lover and i can find the good in any movie centered around it. i tried to like this movie but its just bad and does a disservice to this story. i watched the entire movie only out of stubbornness to admit my poor decision to start watching it", "it is incredibly rare for me to write a review solely for the purpose of expressing my disappointment in a film, but this really does take some beating. i agree with everything dave garfield has written in his review below.the story itself is one that deserves to be told, and not all of the performances are terrible. there are a few scenes that hold up, although it does fail to portray the english pilots in a good light.unfortunately the film is dogged with innaccuracies which are so frequent it becomes hard to ignore and begins to significantly detract from the enjoyment of the film. other reviews cover this in more detail so i'll focus on the real failures:1) language: it doesn't seem hard to work out that modern london 'street' accents didn't actually exist in the 1940s - so much of the british scripting is absolutely terrible, they may as well have talked about what new downloads they had on their i-phone, it was so out of place.2) cgi: oh. my. this really is the worst cgi i've seen in a very long time. the fools who created it not only failed to research the titular aircraft of the film, but they failed to even acknowledge how aeroplanes fly. half the time the planes appear to rotate and float sideways, or flap around like paper, or pull off a turn that would melt a human skeleton - it's like watching kids play with toys. potentially dramatic action sequences just looked terrible and became laughable, and not believable in any way.it's really sad that the heroes of 303 squadron aren't immortalised with a better tribute than this, showing off some good flying - all apparently due to a lack of budget, but even low budget can still have common sense.if you want to see a great film about the battle of britain, watch \"battle of britain\", and save this for when you're drunk.", "this story, and movie, had lots of potential. sadly, it falls short in a number of departments. the script is slack and not true to the era - the way many of the characters behave is simply not credible. most of the cast are unconvincing, although in fairness the lines probably did not help. the central element of young men fighting each day, not knowing which sortie would be their last, is overlooked. the action scenes are cgi heavy and felt rushed, with scarcely any build up of tension. this not to mention a number of dogfighting sequences which were so ludicrous they blew any element of credibility away. avoid.",

editor was either drunk and bored or let their 13 yr old child with add take over.i completely lost what was going on! sloppy and ruined what was a half decent film up until then.switched it off.",

20mins into the film....", "ruined by subtitles i don't understand why filmmakers today seem to think that making a movie where you have to reals half of it it good entertainment.", "could have been good but dialogue, acting and especially direction was just, well, diabolically bad. even the cgi was bad, with control surfaces that did not move (ok i know i'm being picky here) and the cockpit scenes show a canopy which is not connected to the canopy frames. ok so it isn't really that big a deal but taken in context of the overall movie it just show a very very sloppy effort, which is the director responsibility. the actual (true) story is very sad and this should have been a very poinent movie but has been ruined by a ham fisted script and direction.", "this is a well made movie with excellent actors and a good story. i was expecting more of a b movie, but it is not. much better than i anticipated", "terrible, dodgy cgi, awful sound track, with the dramatic weight of 'last of the summer wine'. a woeful waste of what could have been a great movie given the true life story.", "reading the reviews, i am guessing about 75% hate this movie, and 25% love it. i am guessing the 25 % are under 30 years old, don't know much about history (probably couldn't name the decade ww 2 was in) and think all movies must have a love story, even war movies. where to start this is so bad. the stereotypes, the words used, the combat.. i didn't realize german planes flew straight while raf pilots easily lined up behind them and the germans let them shoot them. until the part where we knew some poles had to be shot down for the story to advance. we have a metoo inspired scene, we have women who always know more than their men boss, so girl power too. all british air force girls were all hot, and wore full make up and had their hair done before reporting to war room duty. the music had to be recycled from some made for tv movie, and the writers have to be from some teen drama who is out of work and waiting for their next project. 98% of all british were ungrateful and bigots apparently too. if you watch this and don't know history, you will come out thinking the only thing that saved england was these poles. i couldn't even watch it to the end, bc after about 20 minutes i knew almost all of what would happen bc it is so easy to predict. if you like history, avoid bc it will make you angry. you will wish you had not watched it. if you are under 30, you may like it, but just know the story was real, but this isn't the real story", "another awful british hating low budget film that really isn't worth a watch", "some months back i saw that we were expecting two ww2 movies in september, one being spitfire, the other hurricane. now seeing as i'm a collecter of ww2 artifacts & being a big fan of war movies i looked forward to both movies, hurricane is the first or the two to air & all i can say is i hope spitfire is miles better as hurricane is one of the worst movies i've ever seen...", "i'm sorry but if you have an issue with showing the contribution of the polish and the very idea of depicting racism in the 1940s britain just because some relative says they weren't racist, then why are you reviewing this film? i'm a big believer that your review should be based, not on whether you like the concept, but on whether the film stays true to it's premise/ trailer.to me this was a good production, if you read up on how the polish people were treated by the nazis, soviet and the level of disregard by the allied leaders you will understand how important this is. there were characters from many different perspectives that you could relate to. not every brit was depicted as a big racist like these reviews make out. some people say about poor cgi, it wasn't so bad that it was distracting, it's a bit of a nit pick. perhaps it can be called a 'tv' movie. it certainly doesn't have the budget of 'dunkirk' but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable to watch at home.trust me i've seen some films that have such choppy editing and over the top acting that they deserve a 5.9 rating. this is not one of them.", "cannot see how some reviews are giving this a 9/10 or 10/10 for a low budget movie that is all over the place, other than those reviewers are giving a top prize just for the coverage of the subject matter.as a subject matter it is nice to see a film that covers a neglected story of the exploits of the polish squadron but as a movie it was \"meh\". the time frame covers the period of the battle of britain and if you compare this film to the movie, battle of britain, it is night and day. this movie tries to be everything, which results in no development of any story line. the viewer, if they have little knowledge of about 303 squadron other than peripherally, does not stay emotionally invested as it is just a jumble of scenes without much exploration or resolution.rather than dealing with the exploits of the polish squadron it weaves in a totally unnecessary love interest between a polish flier and a waaf plotter and her story. in one scene the waaf plotter is harassed by an officer because she made him look weak in the plot room. makes for dramatic tension and comes up a couple of times but there is no resolution. it just thrown into the movie and takes away the focus from the polish squadron and the fliers.even has scenes with german fliers and their thoughts on the battle of britain as though this was a story of the battle of britain. so what's the movie about- the 303 squadron, the battle of britain, a waaf plotter and her story? it tries to be all of that and ends up failing to be much of a movie.combat scenes were few and do not tell any storyline to show the success of the poles other than a few spoken lines about how many kills were made by the squadron and a ceremony thanking them for their service and sacrifice. we have a number of scenes where fliers are shot down and burned but as there was little development of the characters, you were not invested and the hospital scenes went nowhere. the movie would have been way, way better if it just concentrated on the day to day fighting and the success and toll on the squadron over the time period of the battle of britain and after.why the movie is called hurricane as it focuses on 303 squadron beats me. for a title of \"hurricane\" it barely shows much of why the hurricane was a match for the german fighters. the cgi combat scenes were horrible as during a dogfight all the fighters flew straight and level while an enemy aircraft closes in for the kill. theses days almost every history buff that has played air combat video games or seen other air combat movies like \"top gun\" knows that flying straight and level makes you a sitting duck. it just screamed \"unreal\" when over and over again the air combat maneuvering was so lacking when so much could be accomplished with cgi today.", "a below average film with bad acting and script that should have been a 3/4 star review. unfortunately, at end of the movie they are celebrating ve day in 1946! an important story that should have been given far better care and attention.", "air combat scenes are totally unrealistic, cheap cgi. the plot and dialogues are also shallow. it does not do justice to the story of polish pilots who fought in ww2", "beautiful movie about the truth finally. poles sacrificing their lifes for england and whole europe. great film, great plot, great actors a must see movie!", "the polish contribution to victory against germany has always been understated. the efforts of 303 squadron were a revelation to me..and i thought i knew a lot about w.w.2. i was always aware that it was a pole who invented the landmine detector..another 'quiet' part of their contribution to the war effort. being a 3rd generation pole myself my grandfather told me much about the war..including how the poles were denied their part in the v.e day celebrations and parade after all they had done. so anyway that off my chest the film was very good..yes the c.g.i could have been better..but it did not detract from a thoroughly enjoyable movie. iwan rheon's polish was so good it had me checking online to find out if he was possibly from poland..he is not! i do not need to say much more. if you liked red tails, memphis belle, the battle of britain, 633 squadron etc or any decent aviation based war film then i think you won't go wrong here.", "they have hurricane planes in world war 2 - you can't not make that awesome. it couldn't possibly be that bad yet it was. the story line jumps around, nothing is well connected, characters never fleshed our at all, effects are farcical, even when they try to build tension or drama it completely failed. so bad in the end my mates and i were just laughing at how bad. this is without question the new version of 'the room'. watch by all means, take some spoons you'll need them.", "i echo what other reviewers have mentioned; a element of the second world war that certainly needed telling, with the polish pilots being front and centre.the production is watchable, but shows the odd hole here and there.the script for me is where the most marks are lost. it follows plenty of well known tropes, trying to balance a 'classic war film' style of the 50's with modern attitudes. overall it feels a bit forced or clunky.one positive i would like to mention; it was good to see/hear all the multiple languages being used.five stars for effort.", "wanted to watch this to hear and experience the true story of the polish airmen and others who helped britain survive (and win) the air war against german air raids in wwii. one of the first things that stood out unfortunately and in a glaring way was how the film is filled with severe expletives and reprehensible filthy foul language. while we do not personally want to listen to that kind of language and we might have overlooked a little of it to finish the film that simply was not possible and we had to shut it off. the movie is so filled with it, i have to also doubt that the language is even historically accurate in how it makes it appear all these pilots and other people in the units spoke and acted that way at the time. it was disappointing the film did not appear to focus on and deliver any true historical accuracy.", "by far one of the worst films i have seen in years. the cgi is probably the worst i have seen from any ww2 movie. for a ww2 fighter film, just watch the 1969 classic battle of britain. seeing real planes in action is far superior to watching cartoon like cgi.", "the plethora of one star reviews here proves one thing: there are a lot of crotchety old history buffs and brits with no sense of perspective. while this film is not perfect, it is well-made, has a solid script, a great soundtrack, excellent acting and very good cg battle scenes.there are a few problems, mainly missed opportunities to explain why the polish pilots were so successful, and to clarify the ill treatment they received as the war dragged on - not just after it ended.the british pilots flew in tight formations, which made them more accessible targets for the germans. the poles eschewed this approach, breaking formation to hunt nazi planes more freely. also, more dramatically, they often attacked head-on in a game of aerial \"chicken\" that panicked the german pilots.the poles were lauded like rock stars, even had groupies... until the americans joined the battle and the poles' services became less urgent.while the film shows the wives of polish pilots being executed by the germans, they fail to mention that at least one of the wives was caught fighting for the polish resistance.and while they clumsily touch on the fact that the poles were totally dissed at the big post-war celebration parade, a few more lines of dialog could have made it more clear that they were excluded to appease stalin (rather than the one murky exclamation by zumbach.)finally, the end crawl could have mentioned that the pilots who returned to poland were persecuted by the communist government.despite all these missed story points, the film is still tight and enjoyable. the characterizations and editing are better than \"dunkirk.\" now if someone would make films about kosciuszko's critical contributions to the american revolution and the polish hussars dramatic rescue of vienna from the turks, the poles will have gotten their just due.", "brits have words to describe this fiction accurately nonsense, poppycock (nonsense), balderdash (\"senseless talk or writing\").books written since 1946 about the hawker hurricane to recent \"the hurricane story\", u.s. laws, british imperial war museum, documented history, say this is fiction and not historically accurate.many reasons the hawker hurricane was almost not built. the hawker hurricanes (wood, fabric, steel tubing) were the majority of the british royal air force, due to a loss of strategic resources (everything had to come from u.s.), so no the hawker hurricanes as the majority of fighters was not only given to foreigners that escaped to england. the global great depression caused by u.s. democrats, nearly collapsed all nations economies tied the u.s. dollar, it was almost considered treason to spend nations money on military and defense (see 2017 movie dunkirk \"we chose butter, the germans chose guns\"). two u.s democrats realized what the democrats did wrote the banking act of 1933, and the banking act of 1935 to make illegal the causes of the 1907 depression and the global great depression.", "the only purpose the movie serves perhaps is to increase awareness of the polish (and czech like frantisek, who flew in polish unit and is mentioned in the film) pilots vital and heroic role in the raf's struggle with the luftwaffe in ww2. the movie is predictably all done with the usual cgi flying footage, and although cgi provides easy cheap access to authentic & accurately drawn airplanes and that occurs here, the actual choreography of aerail movement and dynamics is never even almost realistic or accurate, and that is an issue in this one as well. the aircraft speed and movement , the gunfire, the airplane combat damage from gunfire, none of it is even remotely convincing or correct.and goofs what is he ridiculous black & white cloth flag taken as a souvenir from the shot-down dornier 17 ? what is that even supposed to be? which technical editor approves such a piece of nonsensical rubbish??goof 2. when dorniers like the machine in question were hit by aeroplanes like hurricanes, the tailplane did not burst into flames..you see, there is just nothing about a tailplane to ignite and burn.even the explosions and burning of engines and wings is way over the top in way it was portrayed goof 3. we see one of the hurricanes attacking another dornier 17/215....we cut to an archive gun-camera film..the airplane under attack in the camera film is a he111..not a dornier.the raf men are portrayed as a greater nemesis than the germans are, including the right cad who keeps harassing and assaulting the female lead. seems over the top to me, although i guess it might feature as a storyline in an ep of foyle's war.the wraf women are portrayed as eagerly and cheerfully promiscuous, and the lead female has a mouth like a hardened streetwalker. i was not actually there or around in those days, but i find it far-fetched that the women routinely acted or spoke like that.the other reviewers are right that the subject deserved better on virtually every front. i will not be watching. a re-run or buying the dvd as a gift for anyone. .", "script: probably written by a ten year old. **based** on a true story, (think lip service) crammed with clichés. it's hard to comment on the quality of acting, the script is so poor that the best actors in the world couldn't get 2 stars for their efforts.cgi aircraft and battle scenes, just really really bad. 'in flight' scenes look more like a gentle joy ride than a fight for your life.i don't know how much this movie cost to make but it would be more meaningful if the producers just donated the money to battersea dogs home.", "iwan rheon plays the only plausible character who has any depth. even with much of his lines in polish, his performance outshines everyone else.but then again in a sea of mediocrity perhaps it is not hard to shine.gibson is frankly wooden and there is no trace of his fathers acting ability.none of the other characters offer anything better than if cardboard cutouts had been stood there.this script joins the long and ever growing list, of mediocre dross turned into film. made even worse by truely appalling cgii just couldn't be bothered to watch it to the end.this film is cheap and tacky portrayal of what could have been a riveting telling of a real life story amidst the battle that was to decide the fate of europe.the makers of this film should hang their heads in shame.", "it is appalling to learn and feel what the british did to the polish soldiers in this movie. and to think this was not the only time.the movie reflects the view from the polish very well. love the fact they use the native languages. you have to squeeze your eyes a bit regarding the graphitic effects. but the story and emotions outbalance that", "the accurate aircraft and even cgi dogfights are the only good part of this film. it's slow, boring and the script leaves much to be desired. i really wanted it to be great, but it struggles to be average.", "it was an ok account \"based on a true story\" if by based you mean loosely based then put the emphasis on \"loosely\". on the plus side it does pay homage to the 303 which is a good thing . i consider myself an \"armchair\" historian and the battle of britain is my sweet spot. i think the film did ok but missed a major opportunity to achieve greatness if they had only put the emphasis on factual as opposed to fictional story telling. the truth is while researching many years ago, i stumbled across an account of one of the members of this squadron. one thing lead to another and what i learned about the 303 was nothing short of amazing. the true stories of some of these pilots are far beyond the standard fare of fictional film making. the film hinted at a couple of these astonishing exploits but never fleshed them out or gave credit where it was due. i hope that hollywood realizes their oversight and before they spend millions on another spiderman or godzilla movie do justice to the 303! if you want to know what i am talking about do a little research and see if you are not as blown away as i was.. and am. for that matter let's do a whole \"band of brothers\" for the battle of britain (bob)!!! make a movie that is memorable, inspirational and pays homage where homage is due, that's all i'm saying.", "this is a good film, that stops just short of great. i think with a better budget, directing and removing some unnecessary bits of the plot designed to enrage the audience (and not in a good way), it would have been fantastic. still, there has not been another decent battle of britain film since the 60's, and this is quite a little gem. the cgi isn't great (as in you can tell it's cgi in some scenes), but it's not terrible. the acting is for the most part quite good. they probably play the racial tension card a little too much, and there is a tendency to paint the english raf officers in a bad light, which could have been handled differently. but what it does well is tell the story of the polish (mainly), and overseas contingent of the raf. it shows the appalling losses that all raf squadrons endured and the difficulty these men had in dealing with such losses. this is what the film is really about, and i think it does this very well. all in all quite a good film. i would certainly watch again or buy it for my collection.", "hurricane (a.k.a hurricane: 303

get connected to the viewers. the romantic scenes were also unnecessarily put in the film.acting in the film is good and allmost all the characters were impressive. screenplay of the film is average

i start. some good cast members, however the script is awful, the plotline listless. by far the worst part of this film though is the aerial battle cgi, it's far worse than your average computer game.

share the comments that i have read before typing my own comment here because i was not struck by how inexpensively it was made.i sat through the entire movie and thought how totally unhollywood it looked: it was made virtually like a documentary with no recognisable \"stars\" and a script that called for the natural appearance of women who were virtually in equal number to the men the males in the film.we enjoyed the script that again was normal as opposed to the generally \"movie\" words and dictation eminating from the mouths of unnatuatural hollywood stars in movie make balieve.diane and i as well as the not unexpected approval of the audience enjoyed the film immensly and we would reccomend it unreservedly to future customers.", "as much as i love the fact our polish air force played such an important part in the victory of the battle of britain and our polish airmen contributed greatly to it, the film did not give them justice as they deserved. showing more realistic internal conflicts of each pilot would have benefited. thus, l liked some of the scenes of air battles that reflected the true nature of war casualties and it made me really feel for them. it was nice to see some scenes of british women who served under ata and how little respect they were given by their superiors, but men were glorified for the same jobs. there was also too much focus on one character from the 303 squadron. understandably, the film was meant to pay tribute to the kosciuszko 303 squadron, but i have not been given a chance to really know these pilots, there was not enough substance to build their characters so the viewers were not given a chance to know them better...which is a shame, as the opportunity was there, but it was missed. i am also disappointed why this film was not given a chance to be shown at bigger cinemas, it was meant to show the untold story of our legendary polish pilots, but the film was only limited to very small screens, what a pity!", "thoroughly enjoyed this movie... they were a credit to their country !!", "would this film have been better on a bigger budget, does this film placed british fighter pilots in a certain light whilst it placed polish fighter pilots in another light.... let me tell you what this movie meant to a chap from the just-post-ware generation. i was there in the movie, i was totally engaged and i was in awe of those who helped secure the freedom we enjoy now. brave men! then, as there are now, there were dupki, at raf fighter command as well within the polish ranks. there was no bias in showing the shortcomings of men. what did take me aback was the keenness to repatriate poles after gallant services had been rendered. i very much enjoyed this movie and i thank all those who created it.", "i do agree that the movie and the story could use a bit bigger budget to reach more people but at the same time i do think that the authors did tell the true and very dramatic story of the polish pilots who thought so bravely and were again betrayed not only by their alias but even by the english people who wanted them out of the country as soon as possible after the war ended and did not even invited them to the famous victory parade.", "as you can tell, i am a big fan of any war movie featuring aircraft, since i am an air force retired veteran. i just finished watching this film, and was really impressed with what they did to make this film work. at least it did for me. some reviews were less than gracious, but i found it had all of the elements. thrills, drama, conflict, romance, and flying the wings off a hurricane. britain seems to be out putting more of the war era films, which is their forte. dunkirk, the darkest hour, etc. but hurricane, really was a good film. someone mentioned another movie called \"spitfire\". i hope it's as good or maybe better. either way bring on more of these films. i would also like to see a remake of \"sink the bismark\", a classic that could be improved on with color and sound.", "impossible to review a movie without seeing it ? i will try.1) raising $10 million for a movie in 2018 with a limited release in terms of timing, interest and paid seats needs

a long time. it drew me right in. well done, great script, super actors. everything in this film says talent. don't let the subtitles throw you. there aren't that many. the movie is so well done, you won't care. i really like a good war movie and few have been done this well, and i'm very serious. the characters are on lots of levels and there are lots of sub-plot story lines to follow, but it all comes together (literally) in concert. dogfighting! i have never seen dogfighting like this before i was shocked! pilots (especially) are going to flip out when they see this. (i'm sure) it's packed! there's something going on all the time! it has far more action than memphis bell and just as much story levels as pearl harbor but, this film comes across honestly, and as a real life story, not hollywood candy. lastly, this is based on real events and there are credits to back that up. it's a perfect example of \"history is written by the winners' and i'm moved and glad that this part of history has come out. they are unsung heroes whom (i hope) find broad and solid attention. to sum this up, if you enjoy a good war movie, that has; heart, guts, action, honor and a sense of humor, this will make your keep list.", "i realize it's not a hollywood triumph. still a well done movie and deserves credit where credit is due. see the movie.", "good movie but just don't get it how it possible that movie age restriction is 15 when \"dunkirk\" was 12a. seriously someone lost a plot in bfi, looks like really money talks, and movies with high budgets being favourizes", "ok there are errors but the film is definitely worth watching the script is not the best in the world but it is far from the worst.", "hurricane comes across as a better standard of tv movie than something you'd pay to see, but having said that, it is nevertheless a fine movie. bruce willis had a war movie about wwii planes recently, where the cgi for the planes was awesome, if not the rest of the movie (da hong zha, 2018). likewise the cgi for the planes in this movie was awesome. for that alone it will be certainly be possible to watch this movie again, and more than once, in times ahead. the characters are authentic, at least the brits are, and the two leads share a great respectful romance with some classic lines. the belle was especially attractive. i'm pretty sure the story itself is true, so there is no problem with the plot. if i have a criticism it is that the movie moved a little too quickly to honours for sacrifice. i thought that aspect a little cliche. of course we are all grateful to these brave men, of course we are, and, understanding that, it would be hard to find any real fault in the movie. hurricane is an important historical piece, and at least as exciting as battle of britain (1969) was in its day, even if it doesn't quite command the same dizzy heights of theatre as that classic movie did.", "it's a good film. could be better with bigger budget, but $10.000.000 was enough to make a better film than for example \"air strike\" which costed $65.000.000! and the story of 303 squadron deserves telling.", "when i rented this i was afraid that they hadn't enough money to pull off the requisite dogfight scenes. in fact, i found those scenes were done very well. the characters were compelling as also. the poles were very un-british, but their elan carried them through.", "judging from the comments, people either loved this movie or hated it. i've never seen such a disparity of ratings, lots of tens and lots of ones and twos with little in between. i gave it a ten. superb work. the special effects are stunning. the settings are excellent. the photography and editing are superb. it's certainly in my top five war movies!", "is this movie a wonderful cinematic film? no ... absolutely not. yet (and this is a very big yet), it provides us with a view that we rarely see in western culture. these polish fighter pilots were heroes in the very same sense (if not more) that any wwii pilots were. and these pilots were not given their due. those of us in the u. s. and in western europe have a distinct tendency to overlook or discount the sacrifices and passion of eastern europeans. and that is to our discredit. we owe it to ourselves and to the world to understand that democratic patriotism reaches far beyond the border of a few countries that we are comfortable in acknowledging. watch this film. broader your view of the world.", "a good low-budget film, despite a few errors in war techniques and historical event dates, manages to convey a decent version of the exploits of a group of polish aviators in the so-called battle of britain. the aerial battles depicted in the movie may not be pleasing to experts in the field, as there are numerous errors, from the incorrect overuse of ammunition to mistakes in recreating the dynamics of vehicle explosions. however, this is not a problem with the cgi creators but rather a lack of military experts who could have designed the scenes and sequences better. however, for less experienced eyes, all of this takes a backseat, and the film is well-made enough for the viewer to experience the drama of that wartime episode. the narrative is quite clear, and the dialogues are well-structured. the actors are quite convincing, with the female roles standing out, even though they are not the main characters in the story.many viewers may not like how the pilots have been characterized, both the poles, portrayed as somewhat melancholic drinkers, and the english, depicted as snobbish and arrogant. but this is the screenwriter's vision, using this characterization to provide a cinematic perspective on the film's underlying idea, which is, and it should not be forgotten, to remember those polish pilots of squadron 303.it's true that there are philological errors in the reconstruction of events, inexplicable mistakes, such as the celebration of victory day in 1946. however, i believe these are not major errors, and they do not detract from the credibility of the story. they are simple mistakes due to a lack of attention to detail, likely because of the low budget. one thing is clear, the english aviators don't come off well in this film; it seems that it's thanks to the arrival of the poles that the raf can withstand the onslaught of the luftwaffe. i think this is one of the motivations that has led to the film receiving such low ratings on this platform.", "wow i can't believe the low score reviews on here, loved this film.great acting and great script. a lot of people must've been in a foul mood the day they watched this."]}

well. it seems a bit long, and doesn't really look at real case, affect and solution/outcome, so it all feels a bit pointless. kind of funny in bits, but i wouldn't put comedy as its genre. the female lead acted really well, but other cast members were lacking a bit.", "my apologies to marianna palka, but this is a terrible movie. i am fully able to accept the plot where a woman suffers a mental breakdown and takes on the personality of a dog. yes, she literally thinks she is a dog, and not a friendly family dog, but a mean, aggressive one. she has a terrible and unfaithful husband who leaves all the stress of running a household and caring for 4 kids squarely on her shoulders. it appears she takes on the personality of a dog because dogs have no responsibilities. what makes the story unbelievable are the characters. the dad is such a bad dad that he doesn't know the name of his kids' school. his four kids go to a private school so he is obviously paying several thousand dollars a year. i can understand a bad father being out of touch, but he is spending that kind of money and he doesn't know where his money is going? that's pretty hard to believe. then when the older kids get dropped off at middle school they ask for lunch money. he hands them a $100 bill and asks, \"is this enough?\" really? is the writer trying to show the dad is that far out of touch? or is she trying to show us how frantic the dad has become since mom's disappearance. the two older kids are in middle school. yet, when mom starts acting like a dog those two young teenage kids think it's funny. the way the scene is directed it is not funny, it is disturbing. mom has been missing for a whole day. dad and the mother's sister come into the home after frantically searching the neighborhood for her, and the kids are laughing doing kids things like playing video games. the kids happened to locate their mother. she is in the basement, stripped of all her clothing, covered in her own fecal matter, and literally acting exactly like a vicious dog. if this happened to my mom when i was 12 or 13 i would be incredibly upset and worried. i wouldn't be laughing at the situation.he's also been married to his wife for a while as the oldest is 13 years old, yet he doesn't know the name of his sister in law's husband. his wife's sister does not live across the country. she lives in the same city, and the two sisters appear to be very close. despite this the dad doesn't know the name of the man his sister in law has been married to for years? that's ridiculous. when it becomes obvious the mom needs professional help, the family doctor is called in. he refers them to a professional who deals with these sorts of situations. it's not said in the movie, but this other professional must be a psychiatrist. a real general practitioner with an m.d. is not going to refer an obviously mentally disturbed person to a self-help guru. additionally, this second professional can write prescriptions. after the examination the sister asks the psychiatrist for an official medical term for her condition. the doctor's answer? \"acting like a dog.\" not funny, but stupid. no real psychiatrist is going to say that. i love a good goofy movie. adam sandler and will ferrell movies have their place. in a good, silly movie the dad can be so bad as to not know the name of the kids' schools or their own brother in law. the silly psychiatrist in the silly movie may have an official diagnosis of \"acting like a dog\". however, this movie isn't directed like a silly movie. it's trying to be a realistic, dark comedy. sadly, it cannot be said that the director didn't see the writer's vision and tried to turn a silly movie into a more realistic comedy because the director is the writer. this week stephen spielberg said movies on netflix should not be eligible to win oscsars. don't worry stephen, they're not going to win any oscars.", "came across this on netflix and thought the premise looked interesting. actually thought it was going to be a cheesy horror flick, but was glad it turned out to be something totally unexpected. the acting, especially ritter's is superb. some of the dialog had me cracking up, which i think was intentional. such an unbelievable premise was handled very realistically. there were some very touching moments in the film as well, and all of the characters had some degree of likability. would definitely recommend for those who like the occasional offbeat film. i also felt the ending was appropriate, though folks who like things made more obvious might not.", "nervous breakdown anyone? i guess we can feel with the woman. if not you are as much of a jerk than her husband. and while mr. ritter is usually more of a nice guy on screen, he couldn't be further away with his role here. actually he is so far off the cliff, that it starts hurting. not just the viewer, but the movie as well.of course the main character has to have flaws he has to overcome so the audience will root for him in the end. but this is not just a 180 turn. this is like exorcist like spinning when we arrive towards the end of the movie. so much spinning, that it's almost a surprise not all ended up crawling on the floor.the thing is, for people to care, you have to walk a fine line. something ritter either isn't capable of (charisma-wise) and/or the script isn't giving him a chance. and that is before all the convenient stuff that happens (open doors, smelling only when needed for drama purposes and so forth).now every movie has logic issues if you really break them down, but the good ones have saving graces. why no one interferes, why the story (for \"comedic purposes\") just roles on like that ... it's obvious and you have to lower your bar quite a bit - to acknowledge the good intention of the movie and weigh them in a big way. if you can do that - well you probably have already voted dislike on my comment... but good for you and i mean

mystery to it. or much to it at all. from the first few moments of the movie you see that jill is having a mental break down and you see that her husband is a nightmare. by the end of the movie they try and make it a revelation that we finally have figured it all out... the husband is a nightmare. when we've known this from the very start and all the way through.how is any guy this bad? he acts like a little child who used his wife as a slave. he's the most selfish man i've ever seen in a character. and he can't even see it. why would anyone put up with that for over sixteen years? it's very infuriated to watch it.she turns into a vicious dog? thats whats written on the summery of the film. they show very little images of her as a dog. you mostly hear her, not see her. they refuse to show us how on earth she ran so fast on all fours. and covering herself in human poo is not something a dog does. further more that is down right abuse to leave someone like that. she would start to rot and get serious illnesses. they have some plot holes with this. the movie is more so directed at the husband and how he reacts, not so much jill being dog like.the movie is not funny. there's no mystery. it's mostly all filmed in the colors blue and white. they try and make it fast paced with fast conversations and loud annoying music. it does flow nicely and it keeps interest as you're hoping there will be more to it, unfortunately there's not. it does wrap itself up very nicely. but almost too quickly. it goes from one degree to the next on a dime.", "cringeworthy over-the-top domestic terror comedy. really bizarre, but a kick!", "worst movie i have ever seen. idk if this was supposed to be funny or what but it was awful.", "bitch (2017) rating: 3.4/5the netflix summary for this movie is pretty misleading, even though it's not exactly wrong. it's listed as a dark comedy, but the description sounds like a cheesy horror movie, and somehow the movie manages to be neither. even the title ends up not being the main focus of the film, even though it's kind of the inciting incident for the whole thing. who woulda thought a movie called \"bitch\" would be about a guy learning how to be a better husband and father, once he realizes how much he took his wife for granted.this is a tricky movie to categorize, the whole premise sounds kinda goofy but the film plays it all pretty straight. there are very few funny lines and situations, because the movie isn't trying to be a comedy. you have a mom who gets so overwhelmed by what her life has become, raising 4 kids, married to a cheating husband, who's never home, that she tries to commit suicide and fails. not really a spoiler, its like the opening scene. following that, she mentally shuts down and starts acting like a dog. the rest of the movie is the family and relatives trying to find a way to deal with/help the mom, with a primary focus on the husband and what a self centered person he is.it's a peculiar movie, but i found it to be a breath of fresh air, considering all the sameness we get in movies these days. it won't knock your socks off, but if you like indie -ish films, you may find this entertaining to watch, if you have some free time.", "all the characters with the exception of the woman the husband was having the affair with were unlikable. the kids were bizarre and creepy. the

get rated all the way up to a 5? i may have seen worse movies.... but i currently can't think of any.", "so, let's start off by stating what a lot of reviewers have failed to credit this screenplay author/director/actress with... this was an extremely ambitious movie to make. it's a comedy dealing with an extreme, almost farcical case of mental illness, but it has a serious message relying heavily on raw emotion and brutal drama, not an easy balancing act to pull off by any means, so naturally many elements are hit or miss with a lot of people. i tend to agree with a lot of other reviews saying that the weakest aspect probably comes down to the fact that the father, basically the real protagonist of the movie, comes across as so much of a cartoonish cardboard cutout caricature of what a lowlife good-for-nothing husband/father would be. this plays into the comedy side of the movie, but it definitely hurts the drama side, and to my opinion, at the greater expense of the movie as a whole. does this single aspect destroy the film's credibility? my answer is no it does not, as it just wasn't all that hard for me to relate to the notion of growing up with an almost completely disinterested parent.another question, how credible is the mental disorder angle? my answer to this is, as far fetched as this angle may come across to some people, you'd be surprised at what's lurking out there in the realm of real world psychosis. to me it's believable. the issue here, once again, comes back to how is the main protagonist, the father, handling it. is his reaction believable? again, he's a caricature, completely disconnected from reality and the world he lives in, so he builds up a wall around him, obsessed with maintaining his preconceived traditionalist worldview. that's the whole essence of the movie really, so, is his pseudo \"straight-man\" reaction to the absurd dog woman, a strong enough counterbalance? hotly debatable, and i would argue that if you're looking at it from that angle, maybe that's he wrong way to look at it, because there's a much more poignant dichotomy being explored here.there's a reference made to the scottish psychiatrist r. d. laing. the director being of scottish origin, i would imagine laing was fairly talked about in scotland in his day. basically, his approach to psychiatry was to indulge the delusions of the patient, a revolutionary approach at the time. in 1970 he came out with a film named \"asylum\" to show exactly what he was doing. the idea is that is that the patient never really \"gets better,\" so the intent is to make them feel happy, and normal. from what i've seen, in practice this works better on people who aren't all that messed up to begin with. there was one man in particular in his film who was so incapable of any type of even-keeled socialization, that all he was doing was causing distress to the other patients. the director here i think was actually trying to juxtapose both approaches to mental illness: traditional heavy confinement + prolonged isolation, vs. indulging the fantasy. the whole plot progression is basically the father shifting from one approach to the other, eventually behaving like a dog himself, and saying \"you be whatever you want to be,\" to his wife, after initially having locked her in the basement.r. d. laing's approach, as we all know has been heavily adopted in regards to gender related body dysphoria, and you literally hear the same turn of phrase being used everywhere you go. \"call them whatever they prefer to be called.\" the interesting thing about the way this free-reigns form of psychiatry has been adopted, is that it's been made virtually compulsory across all of society. people have already done jail time for \"misgendering,\" or even talking about the issue itself. as a result, you're seeing more and more people being victim to a hypocritically authoritarian approach to free-reigns psychiatry, people who received the wrong form of treatment which did them harm, misdiagnosed as having gender dysphoria, and in the end, the numbers are going to be so straggering that they won't be able to be repressed anymore, and will represent another colossal abomination in psychiatric history, similar to lobotomies. in my view, the one lesson we can derive from psychiatric history, is that attempting to provide a one size fits all cookie cutter answer to mental health, in and of itself is the core problem, and i think r. d. laing would have probably agreed with this, whether we're talking about a free reigns approach, or the traditionalist approach, which seeks to \"cure\" the condition rather than normalize it. a lot of reviewers seem to have found it difficult to accept this 180 degree change from the father, so i think maybe a little more emphasis should have been placed on this juxtaposition of psychiatric method. if that's what the director was going for, and i don't really think she was intending so in any more than a very peripheral way, there's a 2005 czech film by jan swankmajer named \"sileni,\" which does a better job showcasing that angle of the psychiatric question in particular.the issue that ends up being evermore prevailing in this film, very unfortunately in my opinion, is the man v.s. woman angle, which by far is an angle of lesser value, as usual has being catapulted into the forefront of the discussion by gender based ideological zealotry in the form of feminist theory, which i'm seeing echoed in many other reviews, references to the patriarchy etc., which frankly, the film doesn't attempt to deal with at all. despite being absolutely hands off around this issue, the film definitely gives off feministy vibes, again, simply by virtue of what a caricature the father is. the bottom line, however, is if you're just looking at it from that point of view, it definitely comes across as stale. i mean for christ sake... challenging the concept of traditional marriage roles. what is this, 1970? that's when that subject matter might have resonated on some level. that being said, does the film need to be a socially relevant film to still work? nope. absolutely not, regardless of whether it showcases the psychiatric issue, or the gender issue. i think it's a mistake for the viewer to dwell on either issue, and i tend to look at it as follows. why can't you just have a male character who just happens to be a stereotypical ass, and why can't he be the embodiment of an outdated social structure just for its own sake?it's very easy to try and take from a film, a bigger issue than the film itself realistically encompasses. for example, you could allow yourself to get annoyed over the angle that the father represents an unrealistic uncharitable representation of men and fathers as a whole. in reality, the film never comes across as preachy. i don't like being talked down to by know-it-all ideologues. i didn't get that from this film, and to that extent, the absurdist angle was a huge benefit. this is the type of film that works best if you just take it for what it is, an absurdist take on the very serious and common issue of familial discord, revolving around unfulfilled expectations, and in that respect, the actors did their best to deliver. jaime king, who i never really thought much of before, was actually really good in this, in my opinion. you probably shouldn't take this film as anything more than a portrait of mental chaos, one which delivers the understandably unsatisfying diagnosis, that there is no real \"cure,\" not just to a particular form of psychosis, but to the human condition itself.to me this film does succeed in a major way that a lot of comedic films fail, and that is staying grounded in realism. the comedic elements are often absurd and goofy, but the element of drama is portrayed in a very raw and brutal way. marrying the two is something you don't often see in a film, and i think a lot of people tend to feel uncomfortable combining the two. someone who wants to go let loose to a comedy doesn't necessarily want to feel distraught and uncomfortable in the same breadth of time. ultimately, i don't think you could sell this film as a comedy. you could definitely sell it as a drama though, and to me that's why it was successful; it maintained enough focus to pull together a resonant portrayal of hardship in a way that's not as foreign as the subject itself.", "as a father/husband/son i, and many others like me can relate to this movie. the truth is, as in many other species, the human female does almost everything, that is not coming from the male's inability to help, but from the examples she was tough throughout her life. sometimes we are all going cuckoo, in this case, yeah, she was doing a lot for her 4 kids and her husband, but isn't that selfish to just pretend and leave? brilliant movie, i recommend it, will make you think a lot about your 'real' life also.", "the very delicate point of the movie is focusing on the solidarity role of both husband and wife in the family. jill does everything for her family as a mother and also as a wife, and has been ignored by her husband and as a result; by her kids. there is no way for her to find a time for her own. her vital need of being loved and appreciated has been vanished. the jill's horrible mental disorder is the milestone in the family consciousness. the eyes catches the light in absolute darkness. the appreciation, love, and understanding concludes the family's satisfaction. i admire marianna palka as the writer, director, and specially the stunning performance as the jill's role.", "it's billed as a dark comedy, but i still wasn't prepared for just how dry, acidic, and bitter the humor is. i certainly didn't anticipate the laudable dramatic beats, either. this picture is rife with frenzied energy and excellent performances, and is deeply engrossing.the sheer chaos of the hart household, and its divisions, represent an inescapable black hole of disorder that's terribly gripping. \"protagonist\" jill, collapsing under the constant impossible pressure of an inattentive, unfaithful husband and four unruly kids. \"head of the household\" bill - cheating, ignorant, indifferent, irresponsible, absent from his family's life. the kids themselves are a vortex of looming anarchy waiting for the other shoe to drop. after jill's breakdown, indicated by the premise, her sister beth tries to restore a small semblance of structure to the home, while struggling herself with the scenario.the cast is phenomenal and entrancing in realizing these intense characters. writer, director, and star marianna palka, above all, is outstanding first in realizing jill's grave disconsolation - then the fierce turn to feral, canine-like behavior as she loses herself. at all times the unbridled ferocity and carefree abandon of her performance is riveting. immediately unlikable as bill is in his dire flaws, jason ritter, carrying an unremitting sorrow, manages to make him marginally sympathetic in the desperation that comes to define him. jaime king, as beth, gives a powerful portrayal of the profound alarm that comes with love of family. even the young actors assembled to play the hart children are great, all showing strong personalities, and range exceeding their youth.beyond her fantastic performance, palka demonstrates a keen eye as director, arranging some wonderful shots, including fine consideration of lighting. more than this, her screenplay is a treasure. we easily become invested in the characters, but her narrative writing is exquisite. it would have been very easy to turn the root premise into a pure dark comedy, or even a psychological thriller - and these would have been swell, too - but palka takes the plot in an unexpected direction, demanding greater complexity of the characters in the process. for all the jarring moments that populate much of the film, the last act becomes quite affecting with poignant, touching story beats, and character development. in doing so, the narrative becomes more well-rounded, and satisfying.there are considerable themes at play including and not limited to the endless burdens shouldered by women; work-life balance; spousal neglect; the profound restrictive bonds and expectations of arbitrary gender roles; the unexpected ways our minds can affect our memories, perceptions, and behavior to protect us from trauma - and, of course, learning what's important, and finding peace in life. at no point are the notions underpinning the feature so plain in their expression as to be force-fed, and in fact they tend to be overwhelmed in the presentation by the characters, performances, and narrative generally. still, it's not too difficult to pick up on what palka is laying down.it's also worth mentioning the stellar contributions of behind-the-scenes departments including wardrobe, hair and makeup, art direction, and editing, as no detail is too small to be part of the feature's success. i also greatly enjoy the music composed by morgan z. whirledge. at the most madcap times the score consists largely of grabbing free-form jazz experiments with varied instrumentation and prominent percussion, but the music adapts according to the mood, and always lends much to the air of the picture.i was drawn in by the premise and expected to enjoy this, but still find i'm caught off guard by the skillful construction of the movie as a whole. there's no particular weakness here - writing, direction, and acting are all markedly dexterous, developed well, and at length decidedly rewarding. it's an oddball feature that won't be for everyone by any means, but this is nonetheless a superb accomplishment that's very much worth checking out.two paws up!", "off kilter, strange, odd to say the least, but then it got serious and the last couple of scenes i was in tears. and the closing scene was quite beautiful. the soundtrack at the beginning was very annoying. the noisy kids and how they deal with the situation and the immature and self-centered husband could be true to real life reactions to a mother's devastating spiral down....anyway, i liked it, though i'll pick and choose who i recommend it to since it is a sideways movie. all the adult actors nailed their parts. kids too. young mr. ritter had some chops here in the acting department. bravo.", "i really enjoyed this quirky and emotional movie. it was actually quite brilliant in that at times i was scared, at times i was laughing, and at times i was crying. another reviewer said the movie was \"unbelievable.\" and that's true. just like peter pan or the exorcist is unbelievable. this is an artistic film. to me, the story is really about bill. it's about checking into your life and being there for the people you love. it's about laying down ego and narcissism and embracing the beauty around you in your life and not taking it for granted.", "this is a powerful film that sheds light on mental health and the importance of listening to those in distress. marianna palka's performance is both heartbreaking and eye-opening, showing the effects of emotional neglect in a unique way. jason ritter's character transformation adds depth to the story, making it even more impactful. watching it a second time brought me to tears. thank you to the producer and everyone involved-this film is a strong reminder that when someone is crying for help, we should always listen and support them.i liked it and would recommend for a couple that is about to start a family to watch togother.", "i honestly thought this movie was really fascinating. the actors were great! they definitely pulled me into the plot line. i even cried 2 times! lol the plot line was intriguing and i think the cast definitely pulled it off! the cinematography was also great! overall i don't understand why the ratings are so low, did we watch the same movie? not the best movie i have ever seen but definitely deserves better than a 5. the lead father in the movie had great character development and had me rooting for the family the whole movie despite being a genuine ***hole most of the movie. he really had me hating him for a moment there! 8/10 feels fair!!"]}
